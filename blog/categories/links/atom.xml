<p>If you’ve ever wondered how international law, laws of war and national security policy might be applied to a zombie apocalypse scenario, listen to episode 89 of The Lawfare Podcast.</p>

<p>The law and policy discussed are real and interesting but the tongue-in-cheek analysis is wonderfully entertaining.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ift.tt/1ptSzdx">7th Circuit strikes down gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana</a></p>

<p>The legal momentum favors universal application of the fundamental right of two consenting adults to marry, but that doesn’t make each ruling any less exciting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nytimes.com/2014/07/29/us/spending-big-to-fight-big-donors.html">Larry Lessig fighting for campaign finance reform with Mayday PAC
</a></p>

<p>Lawrence Lessig&rsquo;s <a href="https://mayday.us">Mayday PAC</a> is using the very system it decries to attempt to bring that system down. In other words, Lessig et al are hijacking the virus (the influence of big donors on American politics via election contributions) to deliver the vaccine (funding for politicians committed to proposals which would limit big political contributions).</p>

<p>If you support the cause, be heartened: Lessig <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/27/226834651/record-label-picks-a-fight-over-copyright-with-the-wrong-guy">likes to fight</a>, and is good at it.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t support the cause, it&rsquo;s probably time to start taking Mayday seriously. Your candidate&rsquo;s job may depend on it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ift.tt/1wQ7jYw">Facebook is not free</a></p>

<p>If you use Facebook, this article is a must-read. It’s now common knowledge Facebook is always watching and analyzing how you use the service. But the breadth and depth of the company’s participation in the data brokering economy is staggering. The worst part? You literally signed up for it.</p>

<p>Facebook obviously doesn’t charge its users money, but the mere act of creating a profile affirmatively grants the company total access and usage rights over everything you do on the site. It even shares its data about you with data brokerage firms whose business model is monetizing you.</p>

<p>This is all stuff I have personally known and accepted for a long time, but as the ability to easily aggregate dossiers on anyone and everyone increases, it’s more important than ever to educate yourself and those you care about. Facebook is not free, and in fact it’s worth asking whether the price most people pay by clicking a harmless-looking “I agree” button is really worth it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ift.tt/1roiuqV">Why we don&rsquo;t speak up at work</a></p>

<p>This piece by Claire Lew at Signal v. Noise doesn’t exactly fit into my general topics of law, technology and design, but it’s so important I that feel obligated to share it. I mention in my article about the role of metrics in editorial strategy that I’ve been present for some poor decisions and didn’t speak my mind.</p>

<p>Claire’s post explains exactly why I failed to speak up, and it’s an important read whether you’re a manager or not. Unlike more navel-gazing, hand-wavy articles in the management advice realm, she actually offers some practical advice.</p>
