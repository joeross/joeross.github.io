<div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Atwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">on his blog <em>Coding Horror</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> To those who argue programming is an essential skill we should be teaching our children, right up there with reading, writing, and arithmetic: **can you explain to me how [New York City Mayor] Michael Bloomberg would be better at his day to day job of leading the largest city in the USA if he woke up one morning as a crack Java coder?**
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>(emphasis Mr. Atwood&rsquo;s)</p>

<p>Read his post in its entirety, because it sums up what I&rsquo;ve seen from some other experienced folks who are annoyed by the &ldquo;code as essential life skill&rdquo; mantra. I&rsquo;m actually using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a> to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> right now. I have several reasons for it, and Mr. Atwood would be happy to read that none of them involve the claim that code is, any more than plumbing, an essential life skill.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>One reason I chose to learn the basics of programming is that I began college as a computer science major precisely because I loved the idea of <em>solving problems</em> with code. That&rsquo;s probably why introductory exercises like building a card game app are a struggle for me: I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to play a card game on my computer, so there&rsquo;s no <em>problem</em> to <em>solve</em>. It&rsquo;s the same problem that made it hard for me to concentrate on learning scales when I first started playing guitar. After all, I couldn&rsquo;t play Green Day songs after a few days of mastering scales, so <em>what was the point</em>?</p>

<p>Well, the point was fundamentals. Music, like code, demands mastery of the basics before it cooperates with your will. You can play Green Day <em>sans</em> knowledge of scales all day, but when you start learning Beatles songs, comprehension of what is going on beneath the surface makes playing easier and listening more enjoyable. My blackjack app in Java didn&rsquo;t solve any problem of mine, but it solved the problems posed by the course itself: how do you classify cards? how do you count what&rsquo;s on the table and what&rsquo;s left in the deck? how do you assign and manipulate the values of cards and hands? I was young, and like many young people, I wanted the bigger picture: no to scales, yes to Green Day on stage at a party. No to blackjack, yes to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor that would spit out valid HTML <em>every time</em> (never did it, and never found one).</p>

<h2>Major Change</h2>

<p>My difficulties with calculus and the intersection of that coursework with my Java class pushed me out of computer science and into the English department. I don&rsquo;t regret it because I love literature and I love writing, and I learned skills in the English department at <a href="http://www.sju.edu">Saint Joe&rsquo;s</a> that I use in work and life every day. But I remained enamored with the idea of <em>code as solution</em>. I developed a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, and took perverse joy in wasting hours of my time discovering a one-line fix for something I could have found online and copy/pasted in about thirty seconds. So, years after getting my English degree, I decided to return to code, on a personal quest to finish some of what I had started.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t return to learning code with the hope of joining a startup or making big money on a fancy new web app. That&rsquo;s probably what I was thinking in freshman year of college, but no more. I&rsquo;m working full-time, continuing my education in the evenings, and I&rsquo;m engaged. I&rsquo;m (mostly) grown up, and my perspective has changed.</p>

<h2>Solving Problems, Better</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m good at solving problems, but I always aspire to being better at it. Law school teaches a different perspective on problem solving. It teaches you how to see both sides, advocate for both in your mind, and thereby find your strengths and the opposition&rsquo;s weaknesses. Sometimes, after practice, this mental process becomes very fast. The Socratic method is one way of forcing someone into this mode of thinking: demand justification of a position, pick it apart, and then demand justification for the opposition. It&rsquo;s about breaking complex issues down into their smallest meaningful pieces and looking for solutions to those pieces that, taken together, defeat the larger problem. It&rsquo;s a useful perspective, whether you practice law for a living or not.</p>

<p>Code isn&rsquo;t very different. You use code to approach a problem from the bottom up. You need to dissect the component parts of the problem, you need to parse them out and determine which solutions fit which problems, and which solutions are compatible or incompatible with one another. The difference between the law and code is that the repetition that frequently makes for a powerful rhetorical device in the law is anathema to programmers. Like Atwood said in the post linked at the top of this article, write as little code as possible. Judges are busy and juries feel talked down to when you drone on in legalese for forty-five minutes. Get it done and get out.</p>

<h2>Slow It Down</h2>

<p>Code as perspective is, for me, a source of balanced thinking. Repetition, as I said, can be useful and powerful. But a lawyer, like a programmer, can set up a basic argument, link it to a meaningful phrase, and mention it later for renewed effect. In JavaScript, this is known as a function. It&rsquo;s a piece of code that you package up for easy reuse so you don&rsquo;t have to type it out whenever you need it. If you are a decent writer and rhetorician, you can apply this model to legal (or any other type of) arguments.</p>

<p>Code also demands frequent reference to 1) the things you know and 2) the things you know that you don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not hard to keep track of the things you know, but it&rsquo;s very easy to forget about the things you know that you don&rsquo;t know while in the middle of solving a problem. I&rsquo;ve done it, I&rsquo;ve seen professors and classmates do it, and I&rsquo;ve read <em>many</em> case opinions by judges who never even <em>considered</em> the things that they didn&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t write code, at least not good code, without frequently thinking about the stuff you can&rsquo;t define, the things you can&rsquo;t predict, and the user-provided variables. The same is often true in life and in the law: solve your problems with an eye toward the undefined and the undefinable and your solutions will be more effective and versatile.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bring it back to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s post</a> this way: I&rsquo;m learning to code because problem solving&mdash;<em>not coding</em>&mdash;is an essential life skill, and code provides a unique and invaluable perspective on problem solving.</p>
