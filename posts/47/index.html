<p>Ian Sherr, writing for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> In cross-examination, Mr. Forstall said Eddy Cue, now head of Apple&#8217;s Internet services efforts, had used a 7-inch Samsung tablet for a time, and sent an email to Chief Executive Tim Cook that he believed &#8220;there will be a 7-inch market and we should do one.&#8221;

</blockquote>


<p>While the rumor mill is <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/smartphones/20646/wsj-bloomberg-confirm-apples-785-inch-ipad-mini-plan">still citing anonymous sources</a>, this quote, for me, seals the deal. If Apple thinks there is a market (and at least one of its high-ranking executives does), and Apple thinks it can dominate that market (and they already dominate the ~10 inch tablet market), Apple will enter that market.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Senator Joe Lieberman, speaking to Peter Maass and Megha Rajagopalan of Mother Jones:</p>

<p>The evidence, in this case at least, would suggest otherwise, Mr. Senator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>May 4, 2014: Predictably, perhaps, the theme was discussing is gone. I&rsquo;m using a different one. I&rsquo;ve learned not to post about the theme I&rsquo;m using at a given moment because I have a terrible habit of changing it.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making changes at this site for the past month, but I&rsquo;ve settled on some things and I wanted to explain them to anyone who&rsquo;s interested. Some of it may bore you if you&rsquo;re not a blogger or a WordPress geek. So here&rsquo;s a summary:</p>

<p>This new theme isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, I&rsquo;ll be sharing more links and posting articles more often, I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re reading this, and I hope you keep reading this site in the future.</p>

<p>First, the site&rsquo;s new name, &ldquo;Constant &amp; Endless,&rdquo; is from a line in a wonderful book, and you can read more about why I picked it on my <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/about/">About page</a>. &ldquo;By Joe Ross&rdquo; was really just a placeholder name &mdash;&ndash; it was factual, but also boring and meaningless.</p>

<p>The theme, <em>Twenty Eleven</em>, is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven">designed by WordPress</a>. I tried <em>many</em> different themes, some were starkly modern, like <a href="http://demo.blaskan.net/"><em>Blaskan</em></a> (link points to a theme demo), and others were incredibly lightweight, like <a href="http://mnmlist.com/">mnmlist</a> (link points to a great blog about, what else, minimalism).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the common typeface <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28typeface%29">Georgia</a> right now, and if I don&rsquo;t stick with it, I&rsquo;ll choose another serif. They look classy to me if done well and presented at readable sizes. And that&rsquo;s another thing: I&rsquo;m setting the post font-size at 18px in an attempt to make it readable without leaning forward or squinting, whether on the desktop or the mobile web. Headlines are set in Helvetica/Arial right now, and even if I change the specific typeface, headlines will remain sans-serif.</p>

<p>More broadly, I&rsquo;m using a version of <em>Twenty Eleven</em> customized by a fellow named <a href="http://yjsoon.com/">YJ Soon</a>. His version of the theme is built to work seamlessly with his link-posts plugin, <a href="http://joeross.me/meta/welcome-to-constant-endless/%22http://yjsoon.com/dfll-plugin%E2%80%9D">DFLL</a>. It allows for link posts like those on John Gruber&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a></em>, which lead directly to what you&rsquo;re sharing.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://joeross.me/apple/dont-believe-the-apple-invests-in-twitter-hype-the-verge/">this post</a> of mine to see what I mean. Note how the headline actually links right to the page I quoted. It works that way in my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/byjoeross">RSS feed</a>, too, all thanks to Mr. Soon&rsquo;s plugin. You can read more about the plugin and the other tools I use to maintain this site at my <a href="http://joeross.me/colophon/">Colophon page</a>.</p>

<p>My statistics show at least thirty people subscribed to the feed, so if you&rsquo;re one of them, I hope you enjoy the new link posts, and the longer-form aritcles I plan to keep working on. If you only want articles, or only want links, I&rsquo;ll soon be offering custom feeds for you. If you&rsquo;re like me and you live in your email, you can subscribe that way, too. Use the form at the bottom of the site to sign up for a daily email containing my most recent posts.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>I don&rsquo;t use comments here (more about that in <a href="http://joeross.me/no-comment/">this post</a>), but don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch via my <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/contact/">Contact page</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Updated 12:00 p.m:</strong> Kara Swisher reached out to me on Twitter after I published this post (her tweets and my replies <a href="http://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/226340473277657088">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/226340607541530624">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/226341338336088065">here</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/226341783716642816">here</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/226342099958759424">here</a>).</em></p>

<p>She said she only made minor edits to things like commas and contractions, and that she thought people would assume that she didn’t rewrite the substance. She is right; I should have focused on wanting her take on what I describe below as the interesting bits and not on her revision. She also told me I should have asked her. She is right about that, too. I stand by my wanting some analysis of the areas I mention below where Mayer’s memo departs from PR speak, but to the extent that my post appeared to question Ms. Swisher’s integrity, I am sorry._</p>

<hr />

<p>Kara Swisher, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/">writing at <em>All Things D</em></a> about new Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer’s recent memo to employees:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> I took that to heart in tracking down this do-not-forward (oops) memo —- which I changed around > a bit to thwart those who try to stop me from getting these emails via tricky computer programs […]
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>“Changed around a bit” to what extent? Does that diminish or eliminate the value, if any, of the memo to readers? Was there any value to readers to begin with? My answers are probably “yes” and “no” respectively.</p>

<p>I’m not the only one thinking these things, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/#comment-593020059">some</a> commenters <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/#comment-593127389">asked</a> the same questions. I think Ms. Swisher should have analyzed the interesting parts of the memo, posting little or none of the actual text. It would have been better use of her knowledge and skills, and would have been more valuable to readers.</p>

<p>The memo itself is nothing special. I can summarize it as “I’m happy to be here, I think Yahoo! is great, I have big plans, but don’t stop doing what you’re doing (unless you hear otherwise) until I learn more about the company’s management culture and direction.”</p>

<p>But Ms. Swisher’s casual mention that she edited it gives me pause. It’s not exactly a sensitive diplomatic report, but mysterious edits by a journalist to a document originally written by the subject of the article make me uneasy.</p>

<p>Ms. Swisher is laudably dogged about disclosing her spouse’s role as an executive at Google. There is a link to her <a href="http://allthingsd.com/about/kara-swisher/ethics/">disclosure and ethics policy</a> at the bottom of all her articles. That’s why this offhand mention of memo-revision reads as out of place to me.</p>

<p>Ms. Swisher could have published the unedited version of the memo as an image, likely thwarting any “tricky computer programs” aimed at preventing her future access to such internal emails in the future. Alternatively, she could have simnply written about the bits that weren’t cliche corporate-speak.</p>

<p>For example, Ms. Mayer said in the memo that “While I have some ideas, I need to develop a more informed perspective before making strategy or direction changes.” That suggests the pace of change at Yahoo! under her leadership may initially be slower than observers would like, but will likely accelerate as she soaks up institutional knowledge about how the company functions.</p>

<p>Another interesting bit says “Please don’t stop. If you have questions or concerns about whether to continue or not, please ask. However, with the exception of a few things that might heavily constrain us in the future, the answer is most likely: Yes, keep moving.” What is going on at Yahoo! right now that “might heavily constrain” them in the future if employees don’t pull the plug?</p>

<p>Finally, Ms. Mayer said “We will continue to invest in talent, so we can produce the most compelling and exciting user experiences anywhere.” That tracks with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/dearinternet">the Flickr team’s response</a> to <a href="http://dearmarissamayer.com">dearmarissamayer.com</a>, asking people to apply for jobs there.</p>

<p>But does Ms. Mayer’s comment suggest that Yahoo! will be ramping up compensation and benefits, going on a hiring and expansion spree to bet the company on a new army of innovators, or just building out the kind of infrastructure and marketing that will make current employees proud to work there again?</p>

<p>Ms. Swisher is a journalist and I am not a journalist. She is talented and successful, and no doubt has a better editorial sensibility (or at least a more refined one) than I do. But I can’t help thinking that a breakdown of the memo’s telling points would have been more worthy of her efforts and our reading time than posting it in its entirety with some unknown edits.</p>

<p>I took this quote somewhat out of context and Marco Arment&rsquo;s post about how Apple&rsquo;s new OS X Mountain Lion handles third party app is worth reading.</p>

<p>I just particularly like the reminder that geeks, who sometimes feel marginalized, are often setting trends.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have turned off comments here at <em>Constant &amp; Endless</em>. I have had only one comment since I started writing here, from Mr. Scott Carpenter. He left a good link, and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to alienate him or anyone else who wants to tell me something in response to what I&rsquo;ve written.</p>

<p>But I trust that Scott and anyone else reading this will find it easy to reply to my posts using the avenues listed on my <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page, or described in the posts by others I have linked to later in this piece.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t turn off comments at <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com"><em>Fiction By Joe Ross</em></a> (where, it turns out, Scott has also contributed valuable comments) because it&rsquo;s good to have proposed revisions or critiques right there on the page. This site, however, is a different beast. I could write a long post about why I think this is the right move for most if not all personal small (from one to a few authors) commentary blogs, but the decision is already well-defended by people with bigger audiences (for now…muhahaha) than I.</p>

<p>iOS and Mac OS X developer Matt Gemmell wrote on his popular blog in November 2011 what I consider a bullet-proof reasoning for keeping comments out of personal blogs. He also has great suggestions for different (and, in his opinion and mine, better) ways to respond to something someone has written on their blog. If you don&rsquo;t understand why I turned off comments here, read his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/">initial post</a> and his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/01/03/comments-still-off/">follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>MG Sielger, a general partner at <a href="http://www.crunchfund.com">CrunchFund</a>, a columnist at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/mg-siegler/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, and purveyor of <a href="http://parislemon.com/"><em>parislemon</em></a> and <a href="http://massivegreatness.com/"><em>Massive Greatness</em></a>, chimed in on Gemmell&rsquo;s posts with some thoughts of his own.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Co-creator Jim Ray of <a href="http://www.muledesign.com/">Mule Design</a> describes <em>Evening Edition</em> <a href="http://weblog.muledesign.com/2012/07/evening_edition.php">like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> It&#8217;s a summary of the day&#8217;s news, written by an actual journalist, with links to the best reporting in the world, published once a day.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>Last night, in between reading the news using various Android apps, I spotted a link to John Gruber&rsquo;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/16/evening-edition"><em>Daring Fireball</em> post</a> about <em>Evening Edition</em>. I went to the new news site on my phone and, ten minutes later, I realized I had learned more in that time reading <em>Evening Edition</em> than an hour of playing with Flipboard and Pulse.</p>

<p>I spend all day reading technology news. It&rsquo;s my area of interest and there are some great people reporting on it. But it takes time away from informing myself about what is happening in the <em>world</em> in general.</p>

<p>It looks like <em>Evening Edition</em> beautifully solves that problem. Ray&rsquo;s design is elegant, minimal, and simple. (Put <em>Evening Edition</em> in a browser window next to this site, and you&rsquo;ll realize very quickly why I&rsquo;m such a big fan of Ray&rsquo;s design decisions.)</p>

<p>As for substance, it&rsquo;s like the site&rsquo;s news editor, Anna Rascouët-Paz, secretly knows all the important stuff I either didn&rsquo;t encounter or shamefully skipped over to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/technology/apple-may-meet-tablet-competition-with-smaller-ipad.html?_r=1">another Apple rumor</a>.</p>

<p>Rascouët-Paz boils down complex topics well enough to keep you informed, but also whets your appetite to click through to her sources and get more information. Her summaries contain more rapid-fire facts and quotes than most of what you&rsquo;ll find in the newspaper, and that&rsquo;s a very welcome change.</p>

<p>If you want to read a beautiful website about the important news you missed every day, bookmark <a href="http://www.evening-edition.com"><em>Evening Edition</em></a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Greg Sandoval, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57468798-93/netflixs-lost-year-the-inside-story-of-the-price-hike-train-wreck/">writing at <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>

<p>I <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/in-wake-of-a-bevy-of-new-content-deals-netfli">once asked</a> &ldquo;What is going on at Netflix?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t alone, either. Reed Hastings definitely failed all of his customers in the price-hike/Qwikster debacle, but this good article by Greg Sandoval at <em>CNET</em> points out that Hastings screwed a bunch of perfectly good employees, too.</p>
