  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>I hesitated to change themes because, well, it&rsquo;s one of those things people do instead of writing. But while my customized version of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/9601">Quite Big</a> theme had treated me very well, I hate using Tumblr&rsquo;s default mobile theme on phones, or seeing my desktop-optimized layout on a tablet. I also had modified Quite Big so much that it started to look a little off to me. I know enough HTML and CSS to avoid breaking sites altogether, but over time my changes had started to give the theme a clunky look. I decided that I needed to find the ultimate theme for me: minimal, useful, and responsive.</p>

<h4>Minimal, Useful, and Responsive</h4>

<p>Some people use minimal themes to keep the focus on their content. Others use minimal themes because they think any content placed within a minimal theme will <em>appear</em> great. I think of myself as the former, and it’s why I’ve been personally trending to more minimal site designs for a long time. I consider the use of a minimal site design focused on content to be a commitment. It commits me to quality, and that’s a great thing.</p>

<p>I also want my website’s design to be useful. I’m particularly annoyed when a theme requires me to scroll down to the footer to see how the author describes the site, what other pages are on it, or how you might contact the site’s purveyor. Give me the things I expect when and where I expect them. Yes, it is <em>absolutely</em> a sense of entitlement, but when you’re writing at a blog, you’re writing for whomever is reading. If most people expect things in a certain place, put them there and get to writing the real stuff.</p>

<p>Finally, most free blogging platforms have automatic mobile layouts, but they’re often global, meaning that all sites on the platform end up looking the same on a phone or whatever device the reader is using. This site is on Tumblr because I got tired of maintaining Wordpress and other self-managed CMS installations. I love Tumblr for its simplicity and its Markdown support, as well as its truly beautiful apps. But their “optimized mobile layout,” while minimal and designed for clarity, feels far too cookie-cutter.</p>

<h4>Vision Quest</h4>

<p>After all, a theme, however minimal, does more than determine post width and font face. It sets the tone for the site. It provides a context in which all of your content is going to be experienced. I think of site design, whether for a blog or a corporate portal, as a form of self-expression. Many people get enough self-expression out of being able to share whatever they want, or looking &ldquo;professional&rdquo; or &ldquo;enterprise,&rdquo; and to them the theme of their site isn&rsquo;t important. But I take pride in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>having a vision for how my content should be presented to readers;</p></li>
<li><p>seeking out well-made themes as starting points for that, and</p></li>
<li><p>being able to make customizations that bring the theme I found and the vision I have together</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you can find a theme or site design that fits your vision out of the box, that&rsquo;s great. Nothing beats just applying a new theme and getting to the writing part of it all. But if you do need to modify someone else&rsquo;s design work, it&rsquo;s important to leave credit somewhere in the theme.</p>

<p><strike>I credit <a href="http://idrakimuhamad.me/">Idraki Muhamad</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://mnml-theme.tumblr.com/about">MNML</a> in the footer as well as on my <a href="/about">About</a> page. The changes I&rsquo;ve made fit the design into my vision, but Mr. Muhamad created the theme.</strike></p>

<p><em>Ed. note: I&rsquo;ve moved to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/36900">Observer</a> by Tumblr designer Zach Sultan since first writing this in January, but the principals still apply, and MNML is an awesome theme.</em></p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Most people use blogs as a means to an end, usually to share opinions or showcase work. But geeks often see their blog as an end in itself. If your site is a book, its aesthetic and layout are the cover, and unlike many authors, bloggers have full control over it. I take advantage of that, and I encourage others to do the same.</p>

<p>In a world of cloned &ldquo;default&rdquo; themes, a site design with a little bit of personal nuance will stick in someone&rsquo;s mind. You don’t need to use design to scream “I’m DIFFERENT!” but you should use it to politely remind visitors that, you know, you’re different.</p>

<p>Then, all you have to do is write amazing content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/student-rfid-suspension/">Student loses suit over school ID requirement</a></p>

<p><em>Wired</em>&rsquo;s David Kravets reports that:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> The girl’s father, Steven, wrote the school district explaining why removing the chip wasn’t good enough, that the daughter should be free from displaying the card altogether. “‘We must obey the word of God,” the father said, according to court documents. “By asking my daughter and our family to participate and fall in line like the rest of them is asking us to disobey our Lord and Savior.”
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>Unfortunately, in the modern American climate of violence, it&rsquo;s hard to support someone who refuses to wear an ID, especially with the the tracking removed by the school. You can download the 25-page ruling as a PDF document <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/files_images/general/01-08-2013_Hernandez_Ruling.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50396758#.UOwwVRe04jE">California Scout group recommends openly gay member for Eagle</a></p>

<p>The Scouts&#8217; central authority is unlikely to honor the recommendation because of their culture of fear and hate toward LGBTQ people. And the law may be on Boy Scouts of America&rsquo;s side, at least for now, but history is not. Future generations will look back on private organizations who discriminated based on sexual orientation, however lawfully, with disgust.</p>

I hit the share icon, up came a list of apps, I selected Tumblr, and I was taken to the Tumblr app but as a link share. I wanted an audio share.

<p>This happens whenever I try to share something to Tumblr and it drives me crazy. Hopefully Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s emails to SoundCloud and Tumblr will prompt resolution between their apps, and spur conversation about fixing this kind of thing overall.</p>

<p>Read this example of the stress of immigration, even when it is is very legal and everything is supposedly in order.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2012/09/14/the-new-feedly-mobile-ios-and-android/">Feedly&rsquo;s new vertical page swiping enables speedy feed scanning</a></p>

<p>The recently update to Feedly, my Google Reader-enabled feed reader of choice, is better than ever for speeding through lots of unread items. Feedly has always been able to mark all items read in Google Reader as you swipe through the app, but the vertical scrolling feels more natural and speedier than the old horizontal style. They also implemented a pull-up-to-close gesture within articles which is more intuitive than the double-tap gesture, although the latter still works as well.</p>

<p>Flipboard, Pulse, and similar apps are nice, but I always find myself returning to Google Reader and apps that focus on it. I predict that one day Google will wise up and buy Freely, perhaps merging them with the Currents and Reader projects, and hopefully replacing their functional but boring Google Reader mobile apps.</p>

Initially, my iPhone continued to remain in range, meaning that if I was to walk around the office or different rooms in the house, my Mac remained awake and usable.

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure $6.99 is a viable price for 1.0 app whose developers are still perfecting activation range and that is suffering from &ldquo;random screen locks when the device is still in range,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s a neat concept. I&rsquo;d find it especially useful in an Apple-focused office environment or a co-working space. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/keycard/id578513438">direct link to the iTunes store</a> if you want to check it out.</p>
