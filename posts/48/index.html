<p>I took this quote somewhat out of context and Marco Arment&rsquo;s post about how Apple&rsquo;s new OS X Mountain Lion handles third party app is worth reading.</p>

<p>I just particularly like the reminder that geeks, who sometimes feel marginalized, are often setting trends.</p>

<p>MG Siegler points out that, despite Apple CEO Tim Cook’s quiet mention of Apple TV, the little box Steve Jobs once called Apple’s hobby has sold more units than the best-selling Xbox 360 gaming console.</p>

<p>Not bad for a hobby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have turned off comments here at <em>Constant &amp; Endless</em>. I have had only one comment since I started writing here, from Mr. Scott Carpenter. He left a good link, and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to alienate him or anyone else who wants to tell me something in response to what I&rsquo;ve written.</p>

<p>But I trust that Scott and anyone else reading this will find it easy to reply to my posts using the avenues listed on my <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page, or described in the posts by others I have linked to later in this piece.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t turn off comments at <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com"><em>Fiction By Joe Ross</em></a> (where, it turns out, Scott has also contributed valuable comments) because it&rsquo;s good to have proposed revisions or critiques right there on the page. This site, however, is a different beast. I could write a long post about why I think this is the right move for most if not all personal small (from one to a few authors) commentary blogs, but the decision is already well-defended by people with bigger audiences (for now…muhahaha) than I.</p>

<p>iOS and Mac OS X developer Matt Gemmell wrote on his popular blog in November 2011 what I consider a bullet-proof reasoning for keeping comments out of personal blogs. He also has great suggestions for different (and, in his opinion and mine, better) ways to respond to something someone has written on their blog. If you don&rsquo;t understand why I turned off comments here, read his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/">initial post</a> and his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/01/03/comments-still-off/">follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>MG Sielger, a general partner at <a href="http://www.crunchfund.com">CrunchFund</a>, a columnist at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/mg-siegler/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, and purveyor of <a href="http://parislemon.com/"><em>parislemon</em></a> and <a href="http://massivegreatness.com/"><em>Massive Greatness</em></a>, chimed in on Gemmell&rsquo;s posts with some thoughts of his own. If you still want some more explanation after reading Gemmell&rsquo;s posts, read Siegler&rsquo;s <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15288210624/comments-still-off">initial post</a> and his <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15305835451/bile">follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you want to reply to this post, have a look at my <a href="http://joeross.me/contact">Contact</a> page or write a blog post of your own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Co-creator Jim Ray of <a href="http://www.muledesign.com/">Mule Design</a> describes <em>Evening Edition</em> <a href="http://weblog.muledesign.com/2012/07/evening_edition.php">like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> It&#8217;s a summary of the day&#8217;s news, written by an actual journalist, with links to the best reporting in the world, published once a day.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>Last night, in between reading the news using various Android apps, I spotted a link to John Gruber&rsquo;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/16/evening-edition"><em>Daring Fireball</em> post</a> about <em>Evening Edition</em>. I went to the new news site on my phone and, ten minutes later, I realized I had learned more in that time reading <em>Evening Edition</em> than an hour of playing with Flipboard and Pulse.</p>

<p>I spend all day reading technology news. It&rsquo;s my area of interest and there are some great people reporting on it. But it takes time away from informing myself about what is happening in the <em>world</em> in general.</p>

<p>It looks like <em>Evening Edition</em> beautifully solves that problem. Ray&rsquo;s design is elegant, minimal, and simple. (Put <em>Evening Edition</em> in a browser window next to this site, and you&rsquo;ll realize very quickly why I&rsquo;m such a big fan of Ray&rsquo;s design decisions.)</p>

<p>As for substance, it&rsquo;s like the site&rsquo;s news editor, Anna Rascouët-Paz, secretly knows all the important stuff I either didn&rsquo;t encounter or shamefully skipped over to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/technology/apple-may-meet-tablet-competition-with-smaller-ipad.html?_r=1">another Apple rumor</a>.</p>

<p>Rascouët-Paz boils down complex topics well enough to keep you informed, but also whets your appetite to click through to her sources and get more information. Her summaries contain more rapid-fire facts and quotes than most of what you&rsquo;ll find in the newspaper, and that&rsquo;s a very welcome change.</p>

<p>If you want to read a beautiful website about the important news you missed every day, bookmark <a href="http://www.evening-edition.com"><em>Evening Edition</em></a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/in-wake-of-a-bevy-of-new-content-deals-netfli">once asked</a> &ldquo;What is going on at Netflix?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t alone, either. Reed Hastings definitely failed all of his customers in the price-hike/Qwikster debacle, but this good article by Greg Sandoval at <em>CNET</em> points out that Hastings screwed a bunch of perfectly good employees, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This site is supposed to be me talking about the law and technology, but I have some shameless self promotion to do, so I&rsquo;m deviating from the usual subject matter this week.</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;shameless_self_promotion&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I recently started a new Tumblr called, creatively, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com"><em>Fiction by Joe Ross</em></a>. I&rsquo;m posting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction">flash fiction</a> there, because I love to write it and it&rsquo;s the best I can do length-wise until I finish my JD in December (a semester early, if you&rsquo;re counting, which I am … <em>pats self on back</em>). It&rsquo;s going to be mostly but not <em>all</em> science fiction, so if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing, please check it out and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>I have been writing fiction since, probably, ever. My first short story was a survival tale about a man&rsquo;s struggle in the wilderness. Alas, I can&rsquo;t find it, but I wrote it in high school and I remember being <em>super</em> proud of it. Survival? Wilderness? Sold!</p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote another story in college, call <em>Three Days</em>, which you can get for free <a href="http://leanpub.com/threedays">in eBook format at Leanpub</a>. Did I mention that it&rsquo;s <em>free</em>? Go get it. It has an epidemic, love, psychiatry, and time travel.</p>

<p>I know, genius.</p>

<p>Oh, and <strong>it&rsquo;s okay to tell me you don&rsquo;t like stuff</strong>. You get extra points for being as polite about it as Scott, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time#comment-583582813">my first commenter</a>, was, but what I really want is to know <em>why</em> you didn&rsquo;t like it. Of course, it won&rsquo;t kill me to hear from you even if you <em>did</em> like it, but constructive criticism is wonderful.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m one of those obnoxious people who doesn&rsquo;t <em>mind</em> telling you I&rsquo;m in law school, and working full time, and kind of a big deal because of all that. The bottom line is, though, that I never have much time to write, the little time I <em>do</em> have I use mostly to write about tech news and law stuff, and I have <em>no</em> time at all to edit. So I&rsquo;ve been hoarding all these little scenes of mine, sometimes for years. That hoarding, for better or worse, has come to an end.</p>

<p>As of the publication of this post, I&rsquo;ve already put up two scenes, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time"><em>Carnival Time</em></a> and <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/27079728829/the-deaths-of-dolly-dignan"><em>The Deaths of Dolly Dignan</em></a>. I bet you&rsquo;ll like at least <em>one</em> of them, at least a <em>little</em> bit.</p>

<p>And, even if you don&rsquo;t, and I become a famous author one day, you&rsquo;ll be one of the <em>cool</em> kids who read my stuff long before I was on the bestsellers list. People make fun of people like that but admit it, the truth is that we all <em>love</em> having the chance to <em>be</em> one of them.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s that very chance that I&rsquo;m offering you today, for the future. Or something. <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com">So here&rsquo;s the link, one more time</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howard Mittman, VP and publisher at Condé Nast property Wired Magazine, <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/wired-yorker-pull-back-flipboard/235608/">told <em>Ad Age</em>&rsquo;s Nat Ives</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> I&#8217;m interested in ways to bring advertisers in front of our community. When Flipboard becomes that, I would love to reengage and reinvigorate our product. Until then, we have to wait and see and not allow intermediaries to build their own platforms without direct monetizable benefit back to us.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>This is somewhere between a rock and a hard place. People who consume solely through Flipboard &mdash; a group I suspect is growing all the time &mdash; might not bother clicking through. The friction meant to induce users to view Wired.com might end up dramatically cutting the number of folks reading Wired&rsquo;s content. I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; sentences.</p>

<p>The ad experience on mobile is already dismal for the user &mdash; I only interact with mobile ads by accident. There must be a better way. I know <em>Wired</em> and other content creators need viable revenue streams, and that traditionally the primary stream has been advertising.</p>

<p>But the web, particularly the mobile web, doesn&rsquo;t even allow for the glossy full-pagers that magazines do. Those full-pagers can be compelling, and what&rsquo;s more, they can be blended with the magazine itself.</p>

<p>A glossy full-page ad about the newest gaming laptop would be well-received in an issue focusing on gaming hardware, consoles, and next-generation systems. The same connection is much harder to make on mobile, where space is as precious to the publisher selling the ads as it is to the reader teaching himself how to visually avoid them. Flipboard is so popular because it involves us in the content consumption beyond merely staring at a screen. It&rsquo;s subtle, but that flip is oddly engaging.</p>

<p>If the platform won&rsquo;t accomodate your advertising, it&rsquo;s time for your advertising to accomodate the platform. A headline and a single teaser sentence make for bad user experience: either find a way to participate in full, or get out altogether. Half-measures suggest a lack of innovation and a willingness to make user experience secondary to revenue, when user experience is what brings (and keeps) the eyeballs that bring (and keep) the advertising dollars.</p>

<p>Why can&rsquo;t an advertisement be &ldquo;Flipboard-ized?&rdquo; Why not include in <em>Wired</em>&rsquo;s Flipboard stream an article entitled &ldquo;Ad: Alienware M18x Moves Gaming Laptops into the 21st Century,&rdquo; accompanied by stunning images of the inner workings and outer design of the machine? This offers the same &ldquo;unified experience&rdquo; of which a full-page print magazine ad is capable, but maintains the user experience that makes Flipboard so popular.</p>

<p><strong>Updated 8:30pm:</strong>  <em>Alexia Tsotsis <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/die-less-slow/">briefly interviewed Flipboard CEO Mike McCue</a> about the New York Times&#8217; integration into Flipboard. All digital subscribers to the Times can access the newspaper&rsquo;s full array of online content via Flipboard. More interesting is the fact that the paper&rsquo;s Flipboard content will also include advertisements described by McCue as &ldquo;full page, print style advertising.&rdquo; I respectfully request some credit for at least independently coming up with the model used by the Flipboard/NYT partnership (I somehow missed Tsotsis&#8217; headline while writing this post), but I&rsquo;m happy to see someone is at least trying it out.</em></p>

<p>Something like this seems to be working for Facebook on mobile, according <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/facebook-mobile-ads/">a story by Josh Constine at <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Facebook&rsquo;s formidable <del>data farm</del> social network struggled to find a viable advertising solution to massive uptake in mobile use, and they appear to be on to something.</p>

<p>Maybe organic inline advertising isn&rsquo;t the solution for every mobile advertising problem, but it&rsquo;s an example of the fact that this problem is solvable. My Flipboard/<em>Wired</em> suggestion probably has weaknesses, but let&rsquo;s have that conversation. Let&rsquo;s argue about how the interests of publishers, users, and adverstisers, for all of their apparent conflict, often converge on great value propositions: content <em>and</em> ads that are well-built, well-tailored, and complimentary to one another, rather than shoe-horned next to one another in a way that damages the user experience and decreases all forms of value for everyone.</p>

<p><em>TorrentFreak</em> is unabashedly pro-torrent and, some might argue, pro-piracy if necessary. And they don&rsquo;t exactly divulge great detail on their methodology for determining downloads and viewership. But, let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of a blog post that their numbers are accurate.</p>

<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> pulled an estimated 4.2 million legitimate (read: cable-subscribed) viewers per episode <em>and</em> 3.9 million illegal torrent downloads per episode during its second season. You could even, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5916885/more-people-pirate-game-of-thrones-than-watch-game-of-thrones-on-hbo">as <em>Gizmodo</em>&rsquo;s Casey Chan did</a>, pull legitimate viewership numbers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series">from Wikipedia</a>) and use <em>those</em> alongside TorrentFreak&rsquo;s download numbers to come ot the conclusion that more people pirated the second season than legally watched it. I don&rsquo;t think you need to massage the numbers, though:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Merlin Mann mentioned in passing on episode #69 of his <em>Back to Work</em> podcast with Dan Benjamin, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/69">Seven Dwarfs of Bad Emotion</a>, that he thinks we may go to college too early.</p>

<p>I think he may be onto something, although I understand it isn’t realistic for most people to simply defer college until later in their lives.</p>

<p>But it’s an interesting thought experiment: if the me of today (I’m 28, but insert your own age for fun) started college tomorrow, how much better or worse would he do than the me of age ~19?</p>

<p>I don’t know the answer. I’m going to <a href="http://law.temple.edu">law school</a> at night these days. It’s a very different experience from my undergraduate years. After all, a liberal arts university is full of classes you don’t really care about.</p>

<p>There are still classes I don’t like in law school, but the whole experience is preparing me for a specific career choice. I spent my undergraduate time focused on literary theory and writing. It’s what I love, but nobody told me that it would be so damn difficult getting any kind of job out of it, unless I wanted to become a reporter or work retail or fast food while I worked on my world-changing novel.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.constantandendless.com/code-as-perspective/">elsewhere on this site</a> about how my first major was computer science, but I moved into the English department when calculus, which I simply wasn’t any good at, and Java class converged. It was soul-crushing at the time, and in retrospect, I probably wouldn’t have had such a hard time finding a job if I came out with a degree and a proficiency in coding. But life is a strange beast.</p>

<p>The nature of job competition probably doesn’t allow for any upward revision of the starting age for college. It’s best to finish college as young as possible and begin to accumulate real-world job experience. But if I began undergraduate work today, I would probably get much more out of the experience. I would certainly try harder, even in classes that didn’t interest me right away.</p>

<p>And my brain feels more attuned to the types of both abstract and practical thinking needed to really learn in a classroom setting. I’m a better learner than I’ve ever been, and it’s kind of a shame that the “me” that went to college didn’t have any of the useful experience accumulated by the “me” of today.</p>

<p>Obviously, time travel is the best solution to the problem of “today me” being more ready to excel in college than “college me.” That solution would, of course, require setting aside the limitations described by quantumn physics and irreversibly altering the timeline.</p>

<p>But who wouldn’t set aside physics and the integrity of time itself to improve a previous iteration of themselves?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; writing <a href="http://villagecraftsmen.blogspot.com/2012/05/nookd.html">at his blog <em>Ocracoke Island Journal</em></a> about the ebook edition of <em>War and Peace</em> he bought on his Nook (emphasis below is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> As I was reading, I came across this sentence: &#8220;It was as if a light had been **Nookd** in a carved and painted lantern….&#8221;
>

> For the sentence above I discovered this genuine translation: &#8220;It was as if a light had been **kindled** in a carved and painted lantern….&#8221;
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>That absurd find-and-replace decision was apparently applied to every instance of &ldquo;kindle&rdquo; throughout the ebook.</p>

<p>The publisher of this particular edition is hilariously called <a href="http://superiorformatting.com/">Superior Formatting Publishing</a>. Their website is a Wordpress installation. That&rsquo;s fine for weblogs of note, like this one, but unless you&rsquo;ve hired a solid designer and/or developer, Wordpress probably won&rsquo;t cut it for a publishing website.</p>

<p>The company fumbles even worse in basing the majority of the site&rsquo;s content on Amazon API calls. Amazon has presumably updated something in their API since Superior Formatting Publishing (really, two -ing words in a row?) because most of the site says only &ldquo;Whoops, looks like there was a problem get the book data from Amazon. Please try again in a moment&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Amazon API Error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip&rdquo; makes the point that &ldquo;the ease with which anyone can commit such jackassetry with an ebook and a simple, stupid &#8220;find and replace&rdquo; function. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> It makes one wary of the integrity of any digital version of not only War and Peace…but any e-book.&#8217;
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>He&rsquo;s right. Sure, people could always publish altered versions of a text in the past, but it&rsquo;s far easier to do with digital content than the paper stuff. This instance involves what looks like a very low-budget &ldquo;publisher,&rdquo; but there are many such publishers out there, often with cut-rate prices.</p>

<p>I wonder how many others are find-and-replacing classic works of literature.  Are all such changes merely stupid, like changing &ldquo;kindle&rdquo; to &ldquo;Nook&rdquo; in the hopes (I assume) of avoiding some automated removal from the Nook store? Or are there people out there making the dangerous, destructive changes about which Philip opines?</p>

<p>Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/">still faces legal action</a> from multiple angles on the ebook front, and most big publishers and sellers know that this is still a nascent market.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s what worries me: will the continued growth of the legitimate ebook publishing market mean the continued growth of D-list wannabes like Superior Formatting Publishing? How can we address the potential for the sale of covertly-altered literature? Is it something for the Federal Trade Commission to look into, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/">as they did with blogger endorsements</a>?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always wary of increased government regulation as long as there&rsquo;s a way for the market to take care of itself, but I fear there may always be a market for dirt-cheap ebook editions of literary works, sold with or without the right authorization (public domain, licensing, etc.), and with or without the text as it was actually written by the author.</p>

<p>We should all be careful and discerning about which publishers we go to for ebook editions of the books we want to buy.</p>
