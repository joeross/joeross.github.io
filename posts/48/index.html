  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This site is supposed to be me talking about the law and technology, but I have some shameless self promotion to do, so I&rsquo;m deviating from the usual subject matter this week.</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;shameless_self_promotion&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I recently started a new Tumblr called, creatively, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com"><em>Fiction by Joe Ross</em></a>. I&rsquo;m posting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction">flash fiction</a> there, because I love to write it and it&rsquo;s the best I can do length-wise until I finish my JD in December (a semester early, if you&rsquo;re counting, which I am … <em>pats self on back</em>). It&rsquo;s going to be mostly but not <em>all</em> science fiction, so if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing, please check it out and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>I have been writing fiction since, probably, ever. My first short story was a survival tale about a man&rsquo;s struggle in the wilderness. Alas, I can&rsquo;t find it, but I wrote it in high school and I remember being <em>super</em> proud of it. Survival? Wilderness? Sold!</p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote another story in college, call <em>Three Days</em>, which you can get for free <a href="http://leanpub.com/threedays">in eBook format at Leanpub</a>. Did I mention that it&rsquo;s <em>free</em>? Go get it. It has an epidemic, love, psychiatry, and time travel.</p>

<p>I know, genius.</p>

<p>Oh, and <strong>it&rsquo;s okay to tell me you don&rsquo;t like stuff</strong>. You get extra points for being as polite about it as Scott, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time#comment-583582813">my first commenter</a>, was, but what I really want is to know <em>why</em> you didn&rsquo;t like it. Of course, it won&rsquo;t kill me to hear from you even if you <em>did</em> like it, but constructive criticism is wonderful.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m one of those obnoxious people who doesn&rsquo;t <em>mind</em> telling you I&rsquo;m in law school, and working full time, and kind of a big deal because of all that. The bottom line is, though, that I never have much time to write, the little time I <em>do</em> have I use mostly to write about tech news and law stuff, and I have <em>no</em> time at all to edit. So I&rsquo;ve been hoarding all these little scenes of mine, sometimes for years. That hoarding, for better or worse, has come to an end.</p>

<p>As of the publication of this post, I&rsquo;ve already put up two scenes, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time"><em>Carnival Time</em></a> and <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/27079728829/the-deaths-of-dolly-dignan"><em>The Deaths of Dolly Dignan</em></a>. I bet you&rsquo;ll like at least <em>one</em> of them, at least a <em>little</em> bit.</p>

<p>And, even if you don&rsquo;t, and I become a famous author one day, you&rsquo;ll be one of the <em>cool</em> kids who read my stuff long before I was on the bestsellers list. People make fun of people like that but admit it, the truth is that we all <em>love</em> having the chance to <em>be</em> one of them.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s that very chance that I&rsquo;m offering you today, for the future. Or something. <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com">So here&rsquo;s the link, one more time</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howard Mittman, VP and publisher at Condé Nast property Wired Magazine, <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/wired-yorker-pull-back-flipboard/235608/">told <em>Ad Age</em>&rsquo;s Nat Ives</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> I&#8217;m interested in ways to bring advertisers in front of our community. When Flipboard becomes that, I would love to reengage and reinvigorate our product. Until then, we have to wait and see and not allow intermediaries to build their own platforms without direct monetizable benefit back to us.
>

</blockquote>


<p>This is somewhere between a rock and a hard place. People who consume solely through Flipboard &mdash; a group I suspect is growing all the time &mdash; might not bother clicking through. The friction meant to induce users to view Wired.com might end up dramatically cutting the number of folks reading Wired&rsquo;s content. I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; sentences.</p>

<p>The ad experience on mobile is already dismal for the user &mdash; I only interact with mobile ads by accident. There must be a better way. I know <em>Wired</em> and other content creators need viable revenue streams, and that traditionally the primary stream has been advertising.</p>

<p>But the web, particularly the mobile web, doesn&rsquo;t even allow for the glossy full-pagers that magazines do. Those full-pagers can be compelling, and what&rsquo;s more, they can be blended with the magazine itself.</p>

<p>A glossy full-page ad about the newest gaming laptop would be well-received in an issue focusing on gaming hardware, consoles, and next-generation systems. The same connection is much harder to make on mobile, where space is as precious to the publisher selling the ads as it is to the reader teaching himself how to visually avoid them. Flipboard is so popular because it involves us in the content consumption beyond merely staring at a screen. It&rsquo;s subtle, but that flip is oddly engaging.</p>

<p>If the platform won&rsquo;t accomodate your advertising, it&rsquo;s time for your advertising to accomodate the platform. A headline and a single teaser sentence make for bad user experience: either find a way to participate in full, or get out altogether. Half-measures suggest a lack of innovation and a willingness to make user experience secondary to revenue, when user experience is what brings (and keeps) the eyeballs that bring (and keep) the advertising dollars.</p>

<p>Why can&rsquo;t an advertisement be &ldquo;Flipboard-ized?&rdquo; Why not include in <em>Wired</em>&rsquo;s Flipboard stream an article entitled &ldquo;Ad: Alienware M18x Moves Gaming Laptops into the 21st Century,&rdquo; accompanied by stunning images of the inner workings and outer design of the machine? This offers the same &ldquo;unified experience&rdquo; of which a full-page print magazine ad is capable, but maintains the user experience that makes Flipboard so popular.</p>

<p><strong>Updated 8:30pm:</strong>  <em>Alexia Tsotsis <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/die-less-slow/">briefly interviewed Flipboard CEO Mike McCue</a> about the New York Times&#8217; integration into Flipboard. All digital subscribers to the Times can access the newspaper&rsquo;s full array of online content via Flipboard. More interesting is the fact that the paper&rsquo;s Flipboard content will also include advertisements described by McCue as &ldquo;full page, print style advertising.&rdquo; I respectfully request some credit for at least independently coming up with the model used by the Flipboard/NYT partnership (I somehow missed Tsotsis&#8217; headline while writing this post), but I&rsquo;m happy to see someone is at least trying it out.</em></p>

<p>Something like this seems to be working for Facebook on mobile, according <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/facebook-mobile-ads/">a story by Josh Constine at <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Facebook&rsquo;s formidable <del>data farm</del> social network struggled to find a viable advertising solution to massive uptake in mobile use, and they appear to be on to something.</p>

<p>Maybe organic inline advertising isn&rsquo;t the solution for every mobile advertising problem, but it&rsquo;s an example of the fact that this problem is solvable. My Flipboard/<em>Wired</em> suggestion probably has weaknesses, but let&rsquo;s have that conversation. Let&rsquo;s argue about how the interests of publishers, users, and adverstisers, for all of their apparent conflict, often converge on great value propositions: content <em>and</em> ads that are well-built, well-tailored, and complimentary to one another, rather than shoe-horned next to one another in a way that damages the user experience and decreases all forms of value for everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ernesto <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/game-of-thrones-most-pirated-tv-show-of-the-season-120608/">at <em>TorrentFreak</em></a>:</p>

<p><em>TorrentFreak</em> is unabashedly pro-torrent and, some might argue, pro-piracy if necessary. And they don&rsquo;t exactly divulge great detail on their methodology for determining downloads and viewership. But, let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of a blog post that their numbers are accurate.</p>

<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> pulled an estimated 4.2 million legitimate (read: cable-subscribed) viewers per episode <em>and</em> 3.9 million illegal torrent downloads per episode during its second season. You could even, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5916885/more-people-pirate-game-of-thrones-than-watch-game-of-thrones-on-hbo">as <em>Gizmodo</em>&rsquo;s Casey Chan did</a>, pull legitimate viewership numbers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series">from Wikipedia</a>) and use <em>those</em> alongside TorrentFreak&rsquo;s download numbers to come ot the conclusion that more people pirated the second season than legally watched it. I don&rsquo;t think you need to massage the numbers, though:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Merlin Mann mentioned in passing on episode #69 of his <em>Back to Work</em> podcast with Dan Benjamin, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/69">Seven Dwarfs of Bad Emotion</a>, that he thinks we may go to college too early.</p>

<p>I think he may be onto something, although I understand it isn’t realistic for most people to simply defer college until later in their lives.</p>

<p>But it’s an interesting thought experiment: if the me of today (I’m 28, but insert your own age for fun) started college tomorrow, how much better or worse would he do than the me of age ~19?</p>

<p>I don’t know the answer. I’m going to <a href="http://law.temple.edu">law school</a> at night these days. It’s a very different experience from my undergraduate years. After all, a liberal arts university is full of classes you don’t really care about.</p>

<p>There are still classes I don’t like in law school, but the whole experience is preparing me for a specific career choice. I spent my undergraduate time focused on literary theory and writing. It’s what I love, but nobody told me that it would be so damn difficult getting any kind of job out of it, unless I wanted to become a reporter or work retail or fast food while I worked on my world-changing novel.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.constantandendless.com/code-as-perspective/">elsewhere on this site</a> about how my first major was computer science, but I moved into the English department when calculus, which I simply wasn’t any good at, and Java class converged. It was soul-crushing at the time, and in retrospect, I probably wouldn’t have had such a hard time finding a job if I came out with a degree and a proficiency in coding. But life is a strange beast.</p>

<p>The nature of job competition probably doesn’t allow for any upward revision of the starting age for college. It’s best to finish college as young as possible and begin to accumulate real-world job experience. But if I began undergraduate work today, I would probably get much more out of the experience. I would certainly try harder, even in classes that didn’t interest me right away.</p>

<p>And my brain feels more attuned to the types of both abstract and practical thinking needed to really learn in a classroom setting. I’m a better learner than I’ve ever been, and it’s kind of a shame that the “me” that went to college didn’t have any of the useful experience accumulated by the “me” of today.</p>

<p>Obviously, time travel is the best solution to the problem of “today me” being more ready to excel in college than “college me.” That solution would, of course, require setting aside the limitations described by quantumn physics and irreversibly altering the timeline.</p>

<p>But who wouldn’t set aside physics and the integrity of time itself to improve a previous iteration of themselves?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; writing <a href="http://villagecraftsmen.blogspot.com/2012/05/nookd.html">at his blog <em>Ocracoke Island Journal</em></a> about the ebook edition of <em>War and Peace</em> he bought on his Nook (emphasis below is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> As I was reading, I came across this sentence: &#8220;It was as if a light had been **Nookd** in a carved and painted lantern….&#8221;
> 
>

> 
> For the sentence above I discovered this genuine translation: &#8220;It was as if a light had been **kindled** in a carved and painted lantern….&#8221;
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>That absurd find-and-replace decision was apparently applied to every instance of &ldquo;kindle&rdquo; throughout the ebook.</p>

<p>The publisher of this particular edition is hilariously called <a href="http://superiorformatting.com/">Superior Formatting Publishing</a>. Their website is a Wordpress installation. That&rsquo;s fine for weblogs of note, like this one, but unless you&rsquo;ve hired a solid designer and/or developer, Wordpress probably won&rsquo;t cut it for a publishing website.</p>

<p>The company fumbles even worse in basing the majority of the site&rsquo;s content on Amazon API calls. Amazon has presumably updated something in their API since Superior Formatting Publishing (really, two -ing words in a row?) because most of the site says only &ldquo;Whoops, looks like there was a problem get the book data from Amazon. Please try again in a moment&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Amazon API Error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip&rdquo; makes the point that &ldquo;the ease with which anyone can commit such jackassetry with an ebook and a simple, stupid &#8220;find and replace&rdquo; function. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> It makes one wary of the integrity of any digital version of not only War and Peace…but any e-book.&#8217;
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>He&rsquo;s right. Sure, people could always publish altered versions of a text in the past, but it&rsquo;s far easier to do with digital content than the paper stuff. This instance involves what looks like a very low-budget &ldquo;publisher,&rdquo; but there are many such publishers out there, often with cut-rate prices.</p>

<p>I wonder how many others are find-and-replacing classic works of literature.  Are all such changes merely stupid, like changing &ldquo;kindle&rdquo; to &ldquo;Nook&rdquo; in the hopes (I assume) of avoiding some automated removal from the Nook store? Or are there people out there making the dangerous, destructive changes about which Philip opines?</p>

<p>Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/">still faces legal action</a> from multiple angles on the ebook front, and most big publishers and sellers know that this is still a nascent market.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s what worries me: will the continued growth of the legitimate ebook publishing market mean the continued growth of D-list wannabes like Superior Formatting Publishing? How can we address the potential for the sale of covertly-altered literature? Is it something for the Federal Trade Commission to look into, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/">as they did with blogger endorsements</a>?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always wary of increased government regulation as long as there&rsquo;s a way for the market to take care of itself, but I fear there may always be a market for dirt-cheap ebook editions of literary works, sold with or without the right authorization (public domain, licensing, etc.), and with or without the text as it was actually written by the author.</p>

<p>We should all be careful and discerning about which publishers we go to for ebook editions of the books we want to buy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A former Apple employee, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/apple-siri-disappointment/">talking to <em>Wired</em>&rsquo;s Christina Bonnington</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
>

</blockquote>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know, or care very much, whether that anonymous Apple employee is right or wrong about what Steve Jobs would say about Siri today. But there is a reason Android handset marketers have never focused on <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/">Voice Actions</a> in television commercials and other advertisements:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a great feature. It&rsquo;s <em>good</em>, but definitely not great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something best left to the phone&rsquo;s packaging, or even the user manual. It&rsquo;s something you read about, &ldquo;Control your Android phone just by speaking using Voice Actions,&rdquo; and automatically assume the worst.</p>

<p>Even that line from the official website oversells Voice Actions, but like I said, no one is pushing the feature in marketing materials.</p>

<p>What about Siri, though?</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I&rsquo;m not talking about the law suits filed alleging false advertising or whatever it is they&rsquo;re alleging. I&rsquo;m talking purely about user experience. Let&rsquo;s see how Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri landing page</a> describes the service (bolding is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Siri on iPhone 4S lets you use your voice to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more. **Ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk.** Siri understands what you say, knows what you mean, and even talks back. Siri is so easy to use and does so much, you’ll keep finding more and more ways to use it.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>I use an Android phone, but I&rsquo;ve played with Siri and I&rsquo;ve talked to people who (used to) try to use it. The results are clear:</p>

<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> &ldquo;ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You <strong>can</strong> ask Siri to do <em>some</em> things just by talking <em>sort of like</em> the way you talk.</p>

<p>I love Google Voice Actions, and I absolutely concede that Siri <em>can</em> be wonderful, too. But services that are so dependent on the user&rsquo;s input for the experience they provide do not lend themselves to standard hyperbolic marketing. It&rsquo;s too easy to overshoot, raise consumer expections to unattainable heights, and produce what feels like a flop.</p>

<p>Like Siri.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s <em>modus operandi</em> is to design and build beautiful, simple products to make life easier and more enjoyable. They are accustomed to marketing things that make people line up around the block, and that&rsquo;s how they marketed Siri.</p>

<p>But no one who has tried it would line up around the block for it. No amount of celebrity commercials can change that. Apple needs to iterate quickly and get the &ldquo;beta&rdquo; out from behind Siri&rsquo;s name, and out of the typical user&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>I suspect that if they <em>stopped</em> marketing the hell out of Siri and just produced an update to make it as &ldquo;magical&rdquo; as they have led users to believe it is, they&rsquo;d get more press and consumer goodwill than any ad campaign can buy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57437881-93/microsoft-quietly-launches-so.cl-social-network/">CNET&rsquo;s Steven Musil</a>:</p>

<p>There are two reasons I can&rsquo;t help but be cynical about <a href="http://www.so.cl/">So.cl</a>, Microsoft&rsquo;s latest social search experiment. I have no &ldquo;official&rdquo; user experience training, but both of my reasons might be considered UX critiques:</p>

<p>First, Facebook login suggests an interest in reducing friction, but my experience was anything but smooth. The So.cl page offers to let you <em>sign in</em>, so I tried to sign in with my personal email address but was told that address wasn&rsquo;t connected to a registered Windows Live account. So I tried to register the same email address with Windows Live. Then, I was told it was already connected to a Windows Live account. I registered a different email address as a new Windows Live account and then got a landing page saying they&rsquo;d send me an invitation ASAP. So much for signing in.</p>

<p>Facebook has its claws in  Microsoft&rsquo;s little social experiment, and it&rsquo;s probably <em>profoundly</em> easier to use than Microsoft&rsquo;s own sign-up/in process. Unfortunately, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have a Facebook account must brave Microsoft&rsquo;s abysmal Windows Live process. No third way. This is a classic case of fail, and Danny Sullivan&rsquo;s experience, which he wrote about at his <a href="http://marketingland.com/microsoft-launches-so-cl-social-network-a-quick-look-12499"><em>Marketing Land</em></a> website, suggests the problems I had trying to get into the damn thing only continue as you dig deeper.</p>

<p>Second, Microsoft did stuff it didn&rsquo;t need to waste time doing: creating a stand-alone site and allowing users to: make &ldquo;rich&rdquo; posts (read: blog), &ldquo;riff&rdquo; on other posts (read: reblog, a la Tumblr), and conduct &ldquo;video parties&rdquo; (read: Google Hangouts, but with less features).</p>

<p>As usual, I have some unsolicited advice for a massive technology corporation:</p>

<p>First, let users sign up with an email address. If you want to make that email address automatically a new Windows Live account, fine, but don&rsquo;t ask for ZIP code and gender while you do it. Don&rsquo;t use multiple redirects to sign-up stages, either. Make it <em>simple</em>.</p>

<p>Second, just integrate the experiment into <a href="http://bing.com">Bing.com</a> itself, which looks better every time I visit it. Show users a very prominent one-time explanation and allow interested folks to opt into the experiment. Then, make the So.cl bits a minimal but eye-catching and <em>useful</em> sub-component of each search result or something. <em>Anything</em> but a distinct site. If it feels like a new feature, it&rsquo;s not as off-putting as a stand-alone site, which can feel like a new hungry content monster users are expected to feed.</p>

<p>Microsoft has impressed many people with their design direction on Bing, as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone (aside from the unfortunate fact that we&rsquo;re still calling the last two things &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; at all). Simple user experience stuff like this though shows they still have much room for improvement.</p>

<p>For the record, one of my favorite user experience designs is <a href="http://www.ifttt.com/">ifttt</a>. Show us what you can help us do <em>and how to do it</em> in the same step. That, to me, is an epic UX win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/05/best-of-twitter-in-your-inbox.html">Othman Laraki, Director of Growth and International at Twitter, on the official <em>Twitter Blog</em></a>:</p>

<p>That is true, but Twitter has opted all users into their new weekly email digest. If you don&rsquo;t want it, you&rsquo;ll have to opt out of it. The quoted line is a half-assed way of telling us that.</p>

<p>Twitter is (<a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/19/marco-arment-be-skeptical-of-twitters-innovators-patent-agreement/">arguably</a>) <a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/17/twitter-wont-use-employee-patents-offensively/">progressive on patents</a> and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/08/twitter-motion-to-quash/">protective of privacy</a>, so I won&rsquo;t spend hundreds of words criticizing them on this particular point, but it&rsquo;s worth noting.</p>

<p>Companies introducing new features always have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Companies that force users to opt-out of new features may create annoyance, project a lack of confidence in the feature&rsquo;s likelihood of organic adoption, and give users occasion to second-guess other features the company offers while they&rsquo;re busy trying to turn off the new stuff in their settings panel.</p></li>
<li><p> Conversely, companies that allow users to opt into new features may create goodwill, cause organic word-of-mouth dissemination (much more powerful than the forced version), and help to stagger adoption of resource-intensive features, allowing them to successfully scale.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why more companies don&rsquo;t go with the second option. I find it hard to believe that blind adoption by users too underinformed or lazy to opt-out is somehow more valuable than voluntary adoption.</p>

<p>But the persistence of opt-out feature introductions suggests companies believe exactly that, whether or not it&rsquo;s accurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Atwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">on his blog <em>Coding Horror</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> To those who argue programming is an essential skill we should be teaching our children, right up there with reading, writing, and arithmetic: **can you explain to me how [New York City Mayor] Michael Bloomberg would be better at his day to day job of leading the largest city in the USA if he woke up one morning as a crack Java coder?**
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>(emphasis Mr. Atwood&rsquo;s)</p>

<p>Read his post in its entirety, because it sums up what I&rsquo;ve seen from some other experienced folks who are annoyed by the &ldquo;code as essential life skill&rdquo; mantra. I&rsquo;m actually using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a> to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> right now. I have several reasons for it, and Mr. Atwood would be happy to read that none of them involve the claim that code is, any more than plumbing, an essential life skill.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>One reason I chose to learn the basics of programming is that I began college as a computer science major precisely because I loved the idea of <em>solving problems</em> with code. That&rsquo;s probably why introductory exercises like building a card game app are a struggle for me: I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to play a card game on my computer, so there&rsquo;s no <em>problem</em> to <em>solve</em>. It&rsquo;s the same problem that made it hard for me to concentrate on learning scales when I first started playing guitar. After all, I couldn&rsquo;t play Green Day songs after a few days of mastering scales, so <em>what was the point</em>?</p>

<p>Well, the point was fundamentals. Music, like code, demands mastery of the basics before it cooperates with your will. You can play Green Day <em>sans</em> knowledge of scales all day, but when you start learning Beatles songs, comprehension of what is going on beneath the surface makes playing easier and listening more enjoyable. My blackjack app in Java didn&rsquo;t solve any problem of mine, but it solved the problems posed by the course itself: how do you classify cards? how do you count what&rsquo;s on the table and what&rsquo;s left in the deck? how do you assign and manipulate the values of cards and hands? I was young, and like many young people, I wanted the bigger picture: no to scales, yes to Green Day on stage at a party. No to blackjack, yes to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor that would spit out valid HTML <em>every time</em> (never did it, and never found one).</p>

<h2>Major Change</h2>

<p>My difficulties with calculus and the intersection of that coursework with my Java class pushed me out of computer science and into the English department. I don&rsquo;t regret it because I love literature and I love writing, and I learned skills in the English department at <a href="http://www.sju.edu">Saint Joe&rsquo;s</a> that I use in work and life every day. But I remained enamored with the idea of <em>code as solution</em>. I developed a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, and took perverse joy in wasting hours of my time discovering a one-line fix for something I could have found online and copy/pasted in about thirty seconds. So, years after getting my English degree, I decided to return to code, on a personal quest to finish some of what I had started.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t return to learning code with the hope of joining a startup or making big money on a fancy new web app. That&rsquo;s probably what I was thinking in freshman year of college, but no more. I&rsquo;m working full-time, continuing my education in the evenings, and I&rsquo;m engaged. I&rsquo;m (mostly) grown up, and my perspective has changed.</p>

<h2>Solving Problems, Better</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m good at solving problems, but I always aspire to being better at it. Law school teaches a different perspective on problem solving. It teaches you how to see both sides, advocate for both in your mind, and thereby find your strengths and the opposition&rsquo;s weaknesses. Sometimes, after practice, this mental process becomes very fast. The Socratic method is one way of forcing someone into this mode of thinking: demand justification of a position, pick it apart, and then demand justification for the opposition. It&rsquo;s about breaking complex issues down into their smallest meaningful pieces and looking for solutions to those pieces that, taken together, defeat the larger problem. It&rsquo;s a useful perspective, whether you practice law for a living or not.</p>

<p>Code isn&rsquo;t very different. You use code to approach a problem from the bottom up. You need to dissect the component parts of the problem, you need to parse them out and determine which solutions fit which problems, and which solutions are compatible or incompatible with one another. The difference between the law and code is that the repetition that frequently makes for a powerful rhetorical device in the law is anathema to programmers. Like Atwood said in the post linked at the top of this article, write as little code as possible. Judges are busy and juries feel talked down to when you drone on in legalese for forty-five minutes. Get it done and get out.</p>

<h2>Slow It Down</h2>

<p>Code as perspective is, for me, a source of balanced thinking. Repetition, as I said, can be useful and powerful. But a lawyer, like a programmer, can set up a basic argument, link it to a meaningful phrase, and mention it later for renewed effect. In JavaScript, this is known as a function. It&rsquo;s a piece of code that you package up for easy reuse so you don&rsquo;t have to type it out whenever you need it. If you are a decent writer and rhetorician, you can apply this model to legal (or any other type of) arguments.</p>

<p>Code also demands frequent reference to 1) the things you know and 2) the things you know that you don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not hard to keep track of the things you know, but it&rsquo;s very easy to forget about the things you know that you don&rsquo;t know while in the middle of solving a problem. I&rsquo;ve done it, I&rsquo;ve seen professors and classmates do it, and I&rsquo;ve read <em>many</em> case opinions by judges who never even <em>considered</em> the things that they didn&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t write code, at least not good code, without frequently thinking about the stuff you can&rsquo;t define, the things you can&rsquo;t predict, and the user-provided variables. The same is often true in life and in the law: solve your problems with an eye toward the undefined and the undefinable and your solutions will be more effective and versatile.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bring it back to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s post</a> this way: I&rsquo;m learning to code because problem solving&mdash;<em>not coding</em>&mdash;is an essential life skill, and code provides a unique and invaluable perspective on problem solving.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally posted this to</em> The Verge<em>&rsquo;s Web &amp; Social forum. Read the original forum post <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/7/3004863/googles-live-hangouts-on-air-rolling-out-to-everyone-everywhere-and">here</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Google recently <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/google-hangouts-on-air-broadcast-your.html">announced</a> that, over the next several weeks, they&rsquo;re rolling out the ability to livestream and record <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-92-93-94-95-96-97-98-99-100.html">Hangouts</a> to everyone.</p>

<p>Shameless copy/paste of features:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
>   * _Broadcast publicly._ By checking &#8220;Enable Hangouts On Air,&#8221; you can broadcast your live hangout&#8212;from the Google+ stream, your YouTube channel or your website&#8212;|to the entire world.  
> 
  
>   * _See how many viewers you&#8217;ve got._ During your broadcast, you can look inside the hangout to see how many people are watching live.

>   * _Record and re-share._ Once you&#8217;re off the air, we&#8217;ll upload a public recording to your YouTube channel, and to your original Google+ post. This way it&#8217;s easy to share and discuss your broadcast after it&#8217;s over.
> 
  </blockquote>


<p>Now none of this is really new. Sites like Justin.tv and Ustream, among many others, have been doing this stuff for a long time. But those sites built their communities on top of their streaming services. What interests me about Hangouts On Air is that Google is building their streaming service on top of their community.</p>

<p>Previously, one typically had to know about Ustream and similar services in order to seek them out and take advantage of what they offer. Google, on the other hand, is making the same technology available to myriad people who otherwise would never have considered whether or not they want to do a live video meeting/chat/interview/podcast. And if the functionality is baked into the Google+ apps for Android, users of that mobile OS won&rsquo;t even need to download an additional app.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s awesome. But I also know it comes with dangers. It&rsquo;s an opportunity for, at best, loads more noise in Google+ and other social networking feeds as people experiment with this stuff. At worst, for users, it&rsquo;s a great way to produce and disseminate spam, hate, and other assorted creepiness. At worst, for Google, it won&rsquo;t get any traction at all outside the Google+ fan club. Maybe it will live and die inside Google+, only coming to the attention of non-Plussers when Google decides to shove the Plus platform in peoples&#8217; faces. But Hangouts is built with YouTube technology, and no one should doubt the potential for anything with that kind of foundation.</p>

<p>In addition, there is an interesting tension here between Google and Hangouts On Air and Microsoft&rsquo;s Skype. Right now, podcasting heavyweights like the <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT Network</a> rely heavily on Skype for much of their production. The video-calling software, however, is notoriously prone to dropped calls and &ldquo;Cyloning&rdquo;&mdash;breakdowns in audio and video quality. If Hangouts On Air can avoid those issues, it may become a viable alternative to Skype for those kinds of use cases.</p>

<p>More broadly, Hangouts On Air puts Google on par with Ustream and others in the world of livestreaming news. Google can now function as a platform not only for the uploading and sharing of live video of political speeches, riots, and dispatches from convention floors, but for the distribution of that video content as it happens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t predict all the implications Hangouts On Air will have down the road. But even if it doesn&rsquo;t become wildly popular, it signals that Google is not content to make life searchable after the fact. They want to make it watchable, and interactive, as conversations happen.</p>
