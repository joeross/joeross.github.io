  <div class="entry-content"><p>A former Apple employee, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/apple-siri-disappointment/">talking to <em>Wired</em>&rsquo;s Christina Bonnington</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> “People are embarrassed by Siri,” a former Apple employee told Fortune. “Steve would have lost his mind over Siri.”
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know, or care very much, whether that anonymous Apple employee is right or wrong about what Steve Jobs would say about Siri today. But there is a reason Android handset marketers have never focused on <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/">Voice Actions</a> in television commercials and other advertisements:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a great feature. It&rsquo;s <em>good</em>, but definitely not great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something best left to the phone&rsquo;s packaging, or even the user manual. It&rsquo;s something you read about, &ldquo;Control your Android phone just by speaking using Voice Actions,&rdquo; and automatically assume the worst.</p>

<p>Even that line from the official website oversells Voice Actions, but like I said, no one is pushing the feature in marketing materials.</p>

<p>What about Siri, though?</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I&rsquo;m not talking about the law suits filed alleging false advertising or whatever it is they&rsquo;re alleging. I&rsquo;m talking purely about user experience. Let&rsquo;s see how Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri landing page</a> describes the service (bolding is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Siri on iPhone 4S lets you use your voice to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more. **Ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk.** Siri understands what you say, knows what you mean, and even talks back. Siri is so easy to use and does so much, you’ll keep finding more and more ways to use it.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>I use an Android phone, but I&rsquo;ve played with Siri and I&rsquo;ve talked to people who (used to) try to use it. The results are clear:</p>

<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> &ldquo;ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You <strong>can</strong> ask Siri to do <em>some</em> things just by talking <em>sort of like</em> the way you talk.</p>

<p>I love Google Voice Actions, and I absolutely concede that Siri <em>can</em> be wonderful, too. But services that are so dependent on the user&rsquo;s input for the experience they provide do not lend themselves to standard hyperbolic marketing. It&rsquo;s too easy to overshoot, raise consumer expections to unattainable heights, and produce what feels like a flop.</p>

<p>Like Siri.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s <em>modus operandi</em> is to design and build beautiful, simple products to make life easier and more enjoyable. They are accustomed to marketing things that make people line up around the block, and that&rsquo;s how they marketed Siri.</p>

<p>But no one who has tried it would line up around the block for it. No amount of celebrity commercials can change that. Apple needs to iterate quickly and get the &ldquo;beta&rdquo; out from behind Siri&rsquo;s name, and out of the typical user&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>I suspect that if they <em>stopped</em> marketing the hell out of Siri and just produced an update to make it as &ldquo;magical&rdquo; as they have led users to believe it is, they&rsquo;d get more press and consumer goodwill than any ad campaign can buy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57437881-93/microsoft-quietly-launches-so.cl-social-network/">CNET&rsquo;s Steven Musil</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are two reasons I can&rsquo;t help but be cynical about <a href="http://www.so.cl/">So.cl</a>, Microsoft&rsquo;s latest social search experiment. I have no &ldquo;official&rdquo; user experience training, but both of my reasons might be considered UX critiques:</p>

<p>First, Facebook login suggests an interest in reducing friction, but my experience was anything but smooth. The So.cl page offers to let you <em>sign in</em>, so I tried to sign in with my personal email address but was told that address wasn&rsquo;t connected to a registered Windows Live account. So I tried to register the same email address with Windows Live. Then, I was told it was already connected to a Windows Live account. I registered a different email address as a new Windows Live account and then got a landing page saying they&rsquo;d send me an invitation ASAP. So much for signing in.</p>

<p>Facebook has its claws in  Microsoft&rsquo;s little social experiment, and it&rsquo;s probably <em>profoundly</em> easier to use than Microsoft&rsquo;s own sign-up/in process. Unfortunately, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have a Facebook account must brave Microsoft&rsquo;s abysmal Windows Live process. No third way. This is a classic case of fail, and Danny Sullivan&rsquo;s experience, which he wrote about at his <a href="http://marketingland.com/microsoft-launches-so-cl-social-network-a-quick-look-12499"><em>Marketing Land</em></a> website, suggests the problems I had trying to get into the damn thing only continue as you dig deeper.</p>

<p>Second, Microsoft did stuff it didn&rsquo;t need to waste time doing: creating a stand-alone site and allowing users to: make &ldquo;rich&rdquo; posts (read: blog), &ldquo;riff&rdquo; on other posts (read: reblog, a la Tumblr), and conduct &ldquo;video parties&rdquo; (read: Google Hangouts, but with less features).</p>

<p>As usual, I have some unsolicited advice for a massive technology corporation:</p>

<p>First, let users sign up with an email address. If you want to make that email address automatically a new Windows Live account, fine, but don&rsquo;t ask for ZIP code and gender while you do it. Don&rsquo;t use multiple redirects to sign-up stages, either. Make it <em>simple</em>.</p>

<p>Second, just integrate the experiment into <a href="http://bing.com">Bing.com</a> itself, which looks better every time I visit it. Show users a very prominent one-time explanation and allow interested folks to opt into the experiment. Then, make the So.cl bits a minimal but eye-catching and <em>useful</em> sub-component of each search result or something. <em>Anything</em> but a distinct site. If it feels like a new feature, it&rsquo;s not as off-putting as a stand-alone site, which can feel like a new hungry content monster users are expected to feed.</p>

<p>Microsoft has impressed many people with their design direction on Bing, as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone (aside from the unfortunate fact that we&rsquo;re still calling the last two things &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; at all). Simple user experience stuff like this though shows they still have much room for improvement.</p>

<p>For the record, one of my favorite user experience designs is <a href="http://www.ifttt.com/">ifttt</a>. Show us what you can help us do <em>and how to do it</em> in the same step. That, to me, is an epic UX win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/05/best-of-twitter-in-your-inbox.html">Othman Laraki, Director of Growth and International at Twitter, on the official <em>Twitter Blog</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is true, but Twitter has opted all users into their new weekly email digest. If you don&rsquo;t want it, you&rsquo;ll have to opt out of it. The quoted line is a half-assed way of telling us that.</p>

<p>Twitter is (<a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/19/marco-arment-be-skeptical-of-twitters-innovators-patent-agreement/">arguably</a>) <a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/17/twitter-wont-use-employee-patents-offensively/">progressive on patents</a> and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/08/twitter-motion-to-quash/">protective of privacy</a>, so I won&rsquo;t spend hundreds of words criticizing them on this particular point, but it&rsquo;s worth noting.</p>

<p>Companies introducing new features always have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Companies that force users to opt-out of new features may create annoyance, project a lack of confidence in the feature&rsquo;s likelihood of organic adoption, and give users occasion to second-guess other features the company offers while they&rsquo;re busy trying to turn off the new stuff in their settings panel.</p></li>
<li><p> Conversely, companies that allow users to opt into new features may create goodwill, cause organic word-of-mouth dissemination (much more powerful than the forced version), and help to stagger adoption of resource-intensive features, allowing them to successfully scale.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why more companies don&rsquo;t go with the second option. I find it hard to believe that blind adoption by users too underinformed or lazy to opt-out is somehow more valuable than voluntary adoption.</p>

<p>But the persistence of opt-out feature introductions suggests companies believe exactly that, whether or not it&rsquo;s accurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Atwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">on his blog <em>Coding Horror</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> To those who argue programming is an essential skill we should be teaching our children, right up there with reading, writing, and arithmetic: **can you explain to me how [New York City Mayor] Michael Bloomberg would be better at his day to day job of leading the largest city in the USA if he woke up one morning as a crack Java coder?**
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>(emphasis Mr. Atwood&rsquo;s)</p>

<p>Read his post in its entirety, because it sums up what I&rsquo;ve seen from some other experienced folks who are annoyed by the &ldquo;code as essential life skill&rdquo; mantra. I&rsquo;m actually using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy.com</a> to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> right now. I have several reasons for it, and Mr. Atwood would be happy to read that none of them involve the claim that code is, any more than plumbing, an essential life skill.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>One reason I chose to learn the basics of programming is that I began college as a computer science major precisely because I loved the idea of <em>solving problems</em> with code. That&rsquo;s probably why introductory exercises like building a card game app are a struggle for me: I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to play a card game on my computer, so there&rsquo;s no <em>problem</em> to <em>solve</em>. It&rsquo;s the same problem that made it hard for me to concentrate on learning scales when I first started playing guitar. After all, I couldn&rsquo;t play Green Day songs after a few days of mastering scales, so <em>what was the point</em>?</p>

<p>Well, the point was fundamentals. Music, like code, demands mastery of the basics before it cooperates with your will. You can play Green Day <em>sans</em> knowledge of scales all day, but when you start learning Beatles songs, comprehension of what is going on beneath the surface makes playing easier and listening more enjoyable. My blackjack app in Java didn&rsquo;t solve any problem of mine, but it solved the problems posed by the course itself: how do you classify cards? how do you count what&rsquo;s on the table and what&rsquo;s left in the deck? how do you assign and manipulate the values of cards and hands? I was young, and like many young people, I wanted the bigger picture: no to scales, yes to Green Day on stage at a party. No to blackjack, yes to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor that would spit out valid HTML <em>every time</em> (never did it, and never found one).</p>

<h2>Major Change</h2>

<p>My difficulties with calculus and the intersection of that coursework with my Java class pushed me out of computer science and into the English department. I don&rsquo;t regret it because I love literature and I love writing, and I learned skills in the English department at <a href="http://www.sju.edu">Saint Joe&rsquo;s</a> that I use in work and life every day. But I remained enamored with the idea of <em>code as solution</em>. I developed a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, and took perverse joy in wasting hours of my time discovering a one-line fix for something I could have found online and copy/pasted in about thirty seconds. So, years after getting my English degree, I decided to return to code, on a personal quest to finish some of what I had started.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t return to learning code with the hope of joining a startup or making big money on a fancy new web app. That&rsquo;s probably what I was thinking in freshman year of college, but no more. I&rsquo;m working full-time, continuing my education in the evenings, and I&rsquo;m engaged. I&rsquo;m (mostly) grown up, and my perspective has changed.</p>

<h2>Solving Problems, Better</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m good at solving problems, but I always aspire to being better at it. Law school teaches a different perspective on problem solving. It teaches you how to see both sides, advocate for both in your mind, and thereby find your strengths and the opposition&rsquo;s weaknesses. Sometimes, after practice, this mental process becomes very fast. The Socratic method is one way of forcing someone into this mode of thinking: demand justification of a position, pick it apart, and then demand justification for the opposition. It&rsquo;s about breaking complex issues down into their smallest meaningful pieces and looking for solutions to those pieces that, taken together, defeat the larger problem. It&rsquo;s a useful perspective, whether you practice law for a living or not.</p>

<p>Code isn&rsquo;t very different. You use code to approach a problem from the bottom up. You need to dissect the component parts of the problem, you need to parse them out and determine which solutions fit which problems, and which solutions are compatible or incompatible with one another. The difference between the law and code is that the repetition that frequently makes for a powerful rhetorical device in the law is anathema to programmers. Like Atwood said in the post linked at the top of this article, write as little code as possible. Judges are busy and juries feel talked down to when you drone on in legalese for forty-five minutes. Get it done and get out.</p>

<h2>Slow It Down</h2>

<p>Code as perspective is, for me, a source of balanced thinking. Repetition, as I said, can be useful and powerful. But a lawyer, like a programmer, can set up a basic argument, link it to a meaningful phrase, and mention it later for renewed effect. In JavaScript, this is known as a function. It&rsquo;s a piece of code that you package up for easy reuse so you don&rsquo;t have to type it out whenever you need it. If you are a decent writer and rhetorician, you can apply this model to legal (or any other type of) arguments.</p>

<p>Code also demands frequent reference to 1) the things you know and 2) the things you know that you don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not hard to keep track of the things you know, but it&rsquo;s very easy to forget about the things you know that you don&rsquo;t know while in the middle of solving a problem. I&rsquo;ve done it, I&rsquo;ve seen professors and classmates do it, and I&rsquo;ve read <em>many</em> case opinions by judges who never even <em>considered</em> the things that they didn&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t write code, at least not good code, without frequently thinking about the stuff you can&rsquo;t define, the things you can&rsquo;t predict, and the user-provided variables. The same is often true in life and in the law: solve your problems with an eye toward the undefined and the undefinable and your solutions will be more effective and versatile.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bring it back to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s post</a> this way: I&rsquo;m learning to code because problem solving&mdash;<em>not coding</em>&mdash;is an essential life skill, and code provides a unique and invaluable perspective on problem solving.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally posted this to</em> The Verge<em>&rsquo;s Web &amp; Social forum. Read the original forum post <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/7/3004863/googles-live-hangouts-on-air-rolling-out-to-everyone-everywhere-and">here</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Google recently <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/google-hangouts-on-air-broadcast-your.html">announced</a> that, over the next several weeks, they&rsquo;re rolling out the ability to livestream and record <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-92-93-94-95-96-97-98-99-100.html">Hangouts</a> to everyone.</p>

<p>Shameless copy/paste of features:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
>   * _Broadcast publicly._ By checking &#8220;Enable Hangouts On Air,&#8221; you can broadcast your live hangout&#8212;from the Google+ stream, your YouTube channel or your website&#8212;|to the entire world.

  </blockquote>


<p>Now none of this is really new. Sites like Justin.tv and Ustream, among many others, have been doing this stuff for a long time. But those sites built their communities on top of their streaming services. What interests me about Hangouts On Air is that Google is building their streaming service on top of their community.</p>

<p>Previously, one typically had to know about Ustream and similar services in order to seek them out and take advantage of what they offer. Google, on the other hand, is making the same technology available to myriad people who otherwise would never have considered whether or not they want to do a live video meeting/chat/interview/podcast. And if the functionality is baked into the Google+ apps for Android, users of that mobile OS won&rsquo;t even need to download an additional app.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s awesome. But I also know it comes with dangers. It&rsquo;s an opportunity for, at best, loads more noise in Google+ and other social networking feeds as people experiment with this stuff. At worst, for users, it&rsquo;s a great way to produce and disseminate spam, hate, and other assorted creepiness. At worst, for Google, it won&rsquo;t get any traction at all outside the Google+ fan club. Maybe it will live and die inside Google+, only coming to the attention of non-Plussers when Google decides to shove the Plus platform in peoples&#8217; faces. But Hangouts is built with YouTube technology, and no one should doubt the potential for anything with that kind of foundation.</p>

<p>In addition, there is an interesting tension here between Google and Hangouts On Air and Microsoft&rsquo;s Skype. Right now, podcasting heavyweights like the <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT Network</a> rely heavily on Skype for much of their production. The video-calling software, however, is notoriously prone to dropped calls and &ldquo;Cyloning&rdquo;&mdash;breakdowns in audio and video quality. If Hangouts On Air can avoid those issues, it may become a viable alternative to Skype for those kinds of use cases.</p>

<p>More broadly, Hangouts On Air puts Google on par with Ustream and others in the world of livestreaming news. Google can now function as a platform not only for the uploading and sharing of live video of political speeches, riots, and dispatches from convention floors, but for the distribution of that video content as it happens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t predict all the implications Hangouts On Air will have down the road. But even if it doesn&rsquo;t become wildly popular, it signals that Google is not content to make life searchable after the fact. They want to make it watchable, and interactive, as conversations happen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Farhad Manjoo, <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/05/12/what-eduardo-saverin-owes-america-hint-nearly-everything/">writing at <em>PandoDaily</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> At just about every step between his landing in Miami and his becoming a co-founder of Facebook, you find American institutions and inventions playing a significant part in his success.

</blockquote>


<p>Manjoo doesn&rsquo;t agree with Saverin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-12/facebook-co-founder-may-gain-choosing-singapore-over-u-s-.html">decision to renounce US citizenship</a> just in time to make sure his expected Facebook-IPO windfall escapes capital gains tax, netting him an extra ~$600 million. Manjoo, like Saverin, found a life in the United States he could never have had in his home country.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/05/12/saverins-citizenship-renunciation-before-facebook-ipo-will-increase-not-reduce-his-tax-bill/">it may not be such a clear-cut windfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/just-like-eduardo-nearly-1800-people-renounced-us-citizenship-this-year-over-taxes/2012/05/12/gIQAX1PQKU_story.html">Saverin is certainly not alone</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless, I understand Manjoo&rsquo;s position, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s not realistic. Like I said in <a href="http://fyre.it/119e">a comment on the article</a>, American individuals and businesses avoid as much taxation as lawfully possible every year. Unless Saverin is breaking the law, the rest is probably clickbait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Welcome. I hope the article below helps you. Also consider adding the <a href="http://joeross.me/feed/">RSS feed</a> to your reader or saying hello on <a href="http://twitter.com/joeross">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://google.com/+joeross">Google+</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Lately I have been trying out <a href="http://smarterware.org">Gina Trapani&rsquo;s</a> wonderfully-simple <a href="http://todotxt.com">todo.txt</a>. There&rsquo;s something beautiful about updating my todo list from the command line, syncing it to <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, and managing on the road with the <a href="http://www.todotxt.com/">Android app</a>. It&rsquo;s minimal, elegant, and a tool that solves one problem really well. But I&rsquo;m not sure it will work out for me in the long-run. I&rsquo;m still a big fan of <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google Tasks</a>, first introduce <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-in-labs-tasks.html">in 2008</a>. I want a way to own my data via todo.txt but maintain the convenience of Google Tasks. I didn&rsquo;t quite find it, but I got close, and I at least got a copy of my Tasks data from Google&rsquo;s servers.</p>

<h2>Todo.txt or not todo.txt?</h2>

<p>I live inside my Gmail account for much of the day, and Google Tasks has served me very well for many years. The ability to associate an email with a new task is particularly compelling, and always helps me stay on top of mid-to-long-term response requirements. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks">Tasks Free</a> app for Android this week because it uses Google&rsquo;s Ice Cream Sandwich design language and, like todo.txt, is a simple tool that solves one problem very well.</p>

<p>Unlike todo.txt, however, Google Tasks is easily accessed from the browser, either in Gmail, in a <a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas">full-page view</a>, or any number of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/%22Google%20Tasks%22?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">Chrome addons</a>. As much I like Trapani&rsquo;s philosophy that you should own your data&mdash;that&rsquo;s why todo.txt stores your lists in your Dropbox on all of your computers versus Google Tasks&#8217; only storing your lists on Google servers&mdash;getting it there isn&rsquo;t terribly <em>convenient</em>.</p>

<h2>Best of both worlds?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a compromise insofar as you can install an addon to todo.txt that lets you manually sync to Google Tasks (<a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/Todo.sh-Add-on-Directory#wiki-google">get it here</a>), but the geek force isn&rsquo;t strong enough with me to get it working. It involves creating and executing an additional script (I think it&rsquo;s Python, but I&rsquo;m not even sure) in a newly-created hidden folder within your todo.txt folder.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to give up on todo.txt in general and the Tasks addon specifically because I love tinkering, even with code I know little or nothing about. But even <em>installing</em> todo.txt may be intimidating to those unused to the command line. I suspect I&rsquo;ll come back to it eventually, but for now I&rsquo;ll be using Google Tasks, a reflection on me and not on todo.txt&mdash;it&rsquo;s an amazing app that targets a certain group of more saavy users and serves them extremely well.</p>

<p>If you spend any time in a terminal window or use launchers like <a href="http://qsapp.com">Quicksilver for Mac</a>, todo.txt is the easiest way to manipulate your tasks. I don&rsquo;t spend that much time doing either of those things. Like I said, I spend most of my time in Gmail or on my Android phone.</p>

<h2>Can I use Google Tasks <em>and</em> own my data?</h2>

<p><em>But</em> I <em>do</em> like the idea of owning my data. So I wanted a way to own my Google Tasks data. If I can&rsquo;t sync it to Dropbox, can&rsquo;t I <em>at least</em> periodically download a history of what I&rsquo;ve put in there?</p>

<p>A quick search for &ldquo;export Google tasks&rdquo; turned up <a href="http://dataliberation.blogspot.com/2011/08/introducing-google-tasks-porter.html">this blog post</a> from Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Data Liberation Front</a>, the team responsible for creating the company&rsquo;s data export suite, <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">Google Takeout</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://google-tasks-porter.appspot.com/">Google Tasks Porter</a> is supposed to allow you to pull your Tasks data down from Google&rsquo;s server, or import data from other productivity tools. However, whenever I try to use it to take a snapshot of my tasks, I get the message:</p>

<blockquote>
  `ERROR: Snapshot creation process failed unexpectedly.`
</blockquote>


<p>This error made me sad. It could be that I have so many current/completed/deleted tasks (over 100) that the exporter just chokes on all the data. But then again I&rsquo;ve never thought of &ldquo;too much data&rdquo; as a problem for Google. Discouraged but not defeated, I went to Google Task Porter&rsquo;s open source <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tasks-porter/">Google Code page</a> to see if others had the same problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tasks-porter/issues/detail?id=14">They did</a>.</p>

<h2>The solution: Google Tasks Backup</h2>

<p>Lucky for me (and you), fellow Google Tasks user &ldquo;Julie&rdquo; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tasks-porter/issues/detail?id=14#c11">decided</a> to make her own version of the tool, and <a href="https://tasks-backup.appspot.com/">Google Tasks Backup</a> was born.</p>

<p>The tool, which looks a little like Google&rsquo;s version, just with (<em>much</em>) more explanation and some more options, is quick and easy to use. Authorize it by clicking a button, confirm, and select your desired output format. You can limit the export to include only compelted tasks, only deleted tasks, or those you have &ldquo;cleared&rdquo; from your lists after completion by clicking &ldquo;Clear completed&rdquo; in the Google Tasks interface. Output options include Outlook CSV, iCal ICS, raw CSV, raw CSV with date formatting, or an email formatted for inclusion in your <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> account.</p>

<p>You can also just display the output in HTML as a generated web page. This is what I did, clipping the resulting web page into my <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> account for permanent storage. Alternatively, you could save the web page as HTML to your hard drive or your Dropbox account, or copy and paste it into another piece of software, like a <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Doc</a>. The point is that now you have your Google Tasks history.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any way to automate this or any other export process for Google Tasks, but maybe someday automation service <a href="http://ifttt.com/">ifttt</a> (&ldquo;if this, then that&rdquo;) will plug into the Google Tasks API (released, coincidentally, <a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/05/getting-organized-with-tasks-api.html">one year ago today!</a>) to work its magic for users of Google Tasks. Maybe Google will even fix their own exporter.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>For now though, I&rsquo;m grateful for <a href="https://tasks-backup.appspot.com/">Google Tasks Backup</a>, and I&rsquo;ll let you know if I ever find a good solution to syncing it with <a href="http://todotxt.com">todo.txt</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a post I ran recently at my Posterous blog, announcing my move over here. I thought I&rsquo;d put it here for reference while I finish drafting a proper post about how my personal take on blogging has evolved over the years.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Dear people who read this website,</p>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to tell you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I made a new website. It&rsquo;s located at <a href="http://joeross.me">[http://joeross.me](http://joeross.me)</a>. It is called &ldquo;By Joe Ross.&rdquo; The title may not be creative, but the content will be good.</p></li>
<li><p> I made it because <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/03/welcoming-posterous-team-to-flock.html">Twitter bought Posterous</a> in mid-March, and <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/big-news">Posterous hasn&rsquo;t said a word to its users since</a>. I trust they will give users notice before a shutdown, but TweetDeck has mostly stagnated in the wake of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/25/twitter-confirms-tweetdeck-acquisition">its acquisition by Twitter</a>, and I don&rsquo;t want to keep investing my content in something that will potentially go away soon.</p></li>
<li><p> My Posterous blog, from now on, will consist only of links to new posts at my new blog.</p></li>
<li><p> My new site is a Wordpress.org installation registered via <a href="http://hover.com">Hover.com</a> and hosted (for now, at least) with <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> My new blog will focus on law and technology, and how the two intersect. There won&rsquo;t be many images, because finding images for posts has been a distraction for me and I want to focus on what I&rsquo;m saying.</p></li>
<li><p> My new blog won&rsquo;t include <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/pets">photos of my pets</a>, <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/gaming">thoughts about gaming</a> (unless there&rsquo;s a legal or new-tech angle), or <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/food">posts about food</a>. That kind of stuff will live at <a href="http://joeross.tumblr.com">my Tumblr</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> I will be importing relevant posts from my Posterous blog to my new blog over the next several weeks. I won&rsquo;t post links to those on the Posterous, since that&rsquo;s where they came from.</p></li>
<li><p> I will maintain my Posterous blog for as long as Posterous maintains their service.</p></li>
<li><p> There are at least thirty folks subscribed to my Posterous blog&rsquo;s RSS feed. Thanks for that! But my new feed is <a href="http://joeross.me/feed">here</a>, so update your reader. The feed will remain full-content.</p></li>
<li><p>. I&rsquo;m excited to write more during the summer due to a lighter course load, and I hope you like the new site.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Joe</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>

> The North Carolina amendment alters the constitution to say that &#8220;marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized&#8221; in the state.

</blockquote>


<p>&mdash;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/politics/north-carolina-marriage/">CNN</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t often take a preachy tone, and this story has little to do with how the law and technology intersect, which is my usual topic on this website. However, I think people should be treated the same, and when they&rsquo;re not, I get angry. When masses of people vote for something so clearly despicable that it can accurately be called <em>evil</em>, I have to get my thoughts about it out of my system.</p>

<p>And my thoughts about North Carolina&rsquo;s ban on same-sex marriage are the following:</p>

<p>One day, the descendants of the 61% of North Carolinians who voted discrimination into their constitution today will look back on what their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents did on Tuesday, May 8, 2012 with disgust, much the same way we do when we read the state&rsquo;s <a href="http://think-progress.tumblr.com/post/22691147682/the-last-time-north-carolina-amended-their">nonchalant 1875 ban on interracial marriage</a>.</p>

<p>To the 39% of folks in North Carolina who voted with morals, ethics, and plain old common sense:</p>

<p>I implore you, for the sake of your children, to leave your state. Seek refuge from those among your neighbors who would so blight the wonder of democracy.</p>

<p><em>You</em> are the 39%, who refused to institutionalize hate, to legalize discrimination, to dress up ignorance in the guise of religion, or to use family as a pretext for subjugating a minority. Be proud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I wrote the article below for Temple Law&rsquo;s student newspaper, Prima Facie. While my views on the topic of copyright liability in the modern Internet&rsquo;s &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo; continue to evolve, I haven&rsquo;t made any edits to the version that ran in Prima&rsquo;s April issue. This is a long post, but I would welcome any feedback, including criticism as long as it&rsquo;s constructive. I also include a postscript at the bottom mentioning a recent development that may affect the relevant legal landscape.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Fair use doctrine is a great thing. Its allows limited use of copyrighted works and consists of four factors. Those factors include the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the work used, the amount used relative to the whole work, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the work. These considerations, developed at common law and now included in the Copyright Act at 17 USC § 107, can be powerful tools for art, education, and other endeavors. But they are also widely misunderstood. Copyright law and fair use are in many ways more important than ever. </p>

<p>Ours is an increasingly networked world, marked by everyday activities like sharing things on Facebook and posting things to blogs. The rise of social engagement and the sharing economy has been so meteoric as to pull even the enterprise into its gravitational field. The largest companies in the world are now active on Twitter, and even the late Steve Jobs made his Apple, Inc. email address publicly known, sometimes even sending personal replies to complete strangers.</p>

<p>This is an exciting development, and harbors many of the hallmarks of what early pioneers of the public internet might call “success.” And they would be right. But the internet is a tool, and like any tool, it is only as good or as evil as the people who use it. The internet is used to spread child pornography, to pirate movies and music, and to steal massive amounts of credit card and other sensitive private information. However, somewhere between the glorious interconnection that let frustrated Apple users get the low-down from Mr. Jobs himself, and the internet’s criminal underground, there are more pedestrian, though no less important, issues for us to face.</p>

<p>Issues like Pinterest.com. Well, Pinterest isn’t the issue, the issue is still copyright law and the confusion it often causes when it comes to the internet. Legislation like 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act tries to minimize the liability of service providers for the digital wrongs committed by their users. But those laws don’t (and probably shouldn’t) take similar steps to relieve the users themselves of liability for things like copyright infringement. And therein lies the complication for Pinterest. </p>

<p>The invite-only image sharing site had 11.7 million unique visitors in January 2012, according to web metrics firm comScore. Users keep an eye out for interesting or beautiful images while they’re shopping, reading news, or otherwise surfing the web. When they find something worth bookmarking, they “pin” it, building “boards” based on different topics. Earlier this year, attorney and photographer Kirsten Kowalski wrote a blog post about her misgivings: it looked to her like Pinterest users were engaging in copyright infringement on a scale never before seen. Pinterest, the internet seemed to say in unison, has a very big copyright problem.</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, it’s not really Pinterest’s copyright problem. It’s Pinterest’s users copyright problem, since the DMCA and a well-worded indemnification clause in their terms of service probably get Pinterest themselves off the hook. But the problem with Kowalski’s post, and with the press and viral internet attention it got, is that the “Pinterest problem” is absolutely not on a scale never before seen. This is, in fact, how the internet works. The compliance with the DMCA and solid indemnification clauses keep companies out of hot copyright water, but users are infringing at an astounding daily rate. </p>

<p>The popular blogging service Tumblr gets around twelve billion monthly pageviews. Just Google “tumblr star wars” to get a feel for how much user infringement is going on over there. Sections 9 and 10 of Tumblr&rsquo;s terms of service give them the same indemnity from claims and judgments related to use of the service that Pinterest demands. That’s because Tumblr, Facebook, and others have been around for years, doing exactly what Pinterest does: enabling (and often profiting, directly or indirectly, from) infringement. Publishers often let it go because the traffic and mindshare they derive from this rampant sharing is more valuable to them than the hunt-and-peck game of suing individual infringers. In reality, users agree to assume massive liability in return for the use of myriad blogging services every day, and they have been for a very, very long time. </p>

<p>Pinterest has developed a snippet of website code they refer to as a “nopin” tag that copyright owners can include on their own websites to block Pinterest users from displaying their content via Pinterest. It’s a gesture of goodwill from Pinterest to rights holders, and popular photo sharing site Flickr has made the “nopin” tag an option for its own copyright-holding users. But there’s a better way to empower users to share than mere reliance on the continued laissez-faire legal strategies of publishers and ad hoc website tags.</p>

<p>This brings us back to fair use, the doctrine mentioned at the beginning of this article. Many misconstrue fair use as a right to use someone else’s work regardless of copyright. That’s not what it is at all, though. It is an affirmative defense, only marshaled when a defendant essentially admits to infringing a §106 right. You admit the infringement, but then assert a fair use defense. Under current law, fair use never &ldquo;excuses&rdquo; or &ldquo;permits&rdquo; infringement ex ante.</p>

<p>But maybe it should.</p>

<p>Maybe copyright law should be modified to make fair use an <em>a priori</em> right of the public to use, with certain limitations and restrictions, the copyrighted works of others. That doesn’t mean that Pinterest users would be off the hook, and commercial companies running their own Pinterest boards will always be more likely to draw negative attention from rights holders in copyright as well as trademark and “use of likeness” issues. Users are required to comply with current law.</p>

<p>But fair use as a right instead of an affirmative defense would reduce the chilling effect overbroad copyright law sometimes has, and would facilitate the growth of the sharing economy that has come to define the modern internet.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Postscript:</strong><em> Porn publisher Perfect 10 has sued Tumblr over the many copies of its copyrighted photos the blogging service allegedly stores on its servers. Note that they&rsquo;re not suing Pinterest, despite its recent surge in popularity. As I said, what many call the &ldquo;Pinterest problem&rdquo; predates Pinterest, and as today&rsquo;s news suggests, it might be more aptly termed the &ldquo;Tumblr problem.&rdquo; Read Jeff John Roberts&#8217; <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/05/07/exclusive-publisher-sues-tumblr-over-porn-pics/">post at paidContent</a> for more information.</em></p>
