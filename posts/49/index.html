  <div class="entry-content"><p>Farhad Manjoo, <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/05/12/what-eduardo-saverin-owes-america-hint-nearly-everything/">writing at <em>PandoDaily</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Manjoo doesn&rsquo;t agree with Saverin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-12/facebook-co-founder-may-gain-choosing-singapore-over-u-s-.html">decision to renounce US citizenship</a> just in time to make sure his expected Facebook-IPO windfall escapes capital gains tax, netting him an extra ~$600 million. Manjoo, like Saverin, found a life in the United States he could never have had in his home country.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/05/12/saverins-citizenship-renunciation-before-facebook-ipo-will-increase-not-reduce-his-tax-bill/">it may not be such a clear-cut windfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/just-like-eduardo-nearly-1800-people-renounced-us-citizenship-this-year-over-taxes/2012/05/12/gIQAX1PQKU_story.html">Saverin is certainly not alone</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless, I understand Manjoo&rsquo;s position, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s not realistic. Like I said in <a href="http://fyre.it/119e">a comment on the article</a>, American individuals and businesses avoid as much taxation as lawfully possible every year. Unless Saverin is breaking the law, the rest is probably clickbait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Welcome. I hope the article below helps you. Also consider adding the <a href="http://joeross.me/feed/">RSS feed</a> to your reader or saying hello on <a href="http://twitter.com/joeross">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://google.com/+joeross">Google+</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Lately I have been trying out <a href="http://smarterware.org">Gina Trapani&rsquo;s</a> wonderfully-simple <a href="http://todotxt.com">todo.txt</a>. There&rsquo;s something beautiful about updating my todo list from the command line, syncing it to <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, and managing on the road with the <a href="http://www.todotxt.com/">Android app</a>. It&rsquo;s minimal, elegant, and a tool that solves one problem really well. But I&rsquo;m not sure it will work out for me in the long-run. I&rsquo;m still a big fan of <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google Tasks</a>, first introduce <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-in-labs-tasks.html">in 2008</a>. I want a way to own my data via todo.txt but maintain the convenience of Google Tasks. I didn&rsquo;t quite find it, but I got close, and I at least got a copy of my Tasks data from Google&rsquo;s servers.</p>

<h2>Todo.txt or not todo.txt?</h2>

<p>I live inside my Gmail account for much of the day, and Google Tasks has served me very well for many years. The ability to associate an email with a new task is particularly compelling, and always helps me stay on top of mid-to-long-term response requirements. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks">Tasks Free</a> app for Android this week because it uses Google&rsquo;s Ice Cream Sandwich design language and, like todo.txt, is a simple tool that solves one problem very well.</p>

<p>Unlike todo.txt, however, Google Tasks is easily accessed from the browser, either in Gmail, in a <a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas">full-page view</a>, or any number of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/%22Google%20Tasks%22?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">Chrome addons</a>. As much I like Trapani&rsquo;s philosophy that you should own your data&mdash;that&rsquo;s why todo.txt stores your lists in your Dropbox on all of your computers versus Google Tasks&#8217; only storing your lists on Google servers&mdash;getting it there isn&rsquo;t terribly <em>convenient</em>.</p>

<h2>Best of both worlds?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a compromise insofar as you can install an addon to todo.txt that lets you manually sync to Google Tasks (<a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/Todo.sh-Add-on-Directory#wiki-google">get it here</a>), but the geek force isn&rsquo;t strong enough with me to get it working. It involves creating and executing an additional script (I think it&rsquo;s Python, but I&rsquo;m not even sure) in a newly-created hidden folder within your todo.txt folder.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to give up on todo.txt in general and the Tasks addon specifically because I love tinkering, even with code I know little or nothing about. But even <em>installing</em> todo.txt may be intimidating to those unused to the command line. I suspect I&rsquo;ll come back to it eventually, but for now I&rsquo;ll be using Google Tasks, a reflection on me and not on todo.txt&mdash;it&rsquo;s an amazing app that targets a certain group of more saavy users and serves them extremely well.</p>

<p>If you spend any time in a terminal window or use launchers like <a href="http://qsapp.com">Quicksilver for Mac</a>, todo.txt is the easiest way to manipulate your tasks. I don&rsquo;t spend that much time doing either of those things. Like I said, I spend most of my time in Gmail or on my Android phone.</p>

<h2>Can I use Google Tasks <em>and</em> own my data?</h2>

<p><em>But</em> I <em>do</em> like the idea of owning my data. So I wanted a way to own my Google Tasks data. If I can&rsquo;t sync it to Dropbox, can&rsquo;t I <em>at least</em> periodically download a history of what I&rsquo;ve put in there?</p>

<p>A quick search for &ldquo;export Google tasks&rdquo; turned up <a href="http://dataliberation.blogspot.com/2011/08/introducing-google-tasks-porter.html">this blog post</a> from Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Data Liberation Front</a>, the team responsible for creating the company&rsquo;s data export suite, <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">Google Takeout</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://google-tasks-porter.appspot.com/">Google Tasks Porter</a> is supposed to allow you to pull your Tasks data down from Google&rsquo;s server, or import data from other productivity tools. However, whenever I try to use it to take a snapshot of my tasks, I get the message:</p>

<blockquote>
  `ERROR: Snapshot creation process failed unexpectedly.`
</blockquote>


<p>This error made me sad. It could be that I have so many current/completed/deleted tasks (over 100) that the exporter just chokes on all the data. But then again I&rsquo;ve never thought of &ldquo;too much data&rdquo; as a problem for Google. Discouraged but not defeated, I went to Google Task Porter&rsquo;s open source <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tasks-porter/">Google Code page</a> to see if others had the same problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tasks-porter/issues/detail?id=14">They did</a>.</p>

<h2>The solution: Google Tasks Backup</h2>

<p>Lucky for me (and you), fellow Google Tasks user &ldquo;Julie&rdquo; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tasks-porter/issues/detail?id=14#c11">decided</a> to make her own version of the tool, and <a href="https://tasks-backup.appspot.com/">Google Tasks Backup</a> was born.</p>

<p>The tool, which looks a little like Google&rsquo;s version, just with (<em>much</em>) more explanation and some more options, is quick and easy to use. Authorize it by clicking a button, confirm, and select your desired output format. You can limit the export to include only compelted tasks, only deleted tasks, or those you have &ldquo;cleared&rdquo; from your lists after completion by clicking &ldquo;Clear completed&rdquo; in the Google Tasks interface. Output options include Outlook CSV, iCal ICS, raw CSV, raw CSV with date formatting, or an email formatted for inclusion in your <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> account.</p>

<p>You can also just display the output in HTML as a generated web page. This is what I did, clipping the resulting web page into my <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> account for permanent storage. Alternatively, you could save the web page as HTML to your hard drive or your Dropbox account, or copy and paste it into another piece of software, like a <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Doc</a>. The point is that now you have your Google Tasks history.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any way to automate this or any other export process for Google Tasks, but maybe someday automation service <a href="http://ifttt.com/">ifttt</a> (&ldquo;if this, then that&rdquo;) will plug into the Google Tasks API (released, coincidentally, <a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/05/getting-organized-with-tasks-api.html">one year ago today!</a>) to work its magic for users of Google Tasks. Maybe Google will even fix their own exporter.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>For now though, I&rsquo;m grateful for <a href="https://tasks-backup.appspot.com/">Google Tasks Backup</a>, and I&rsquo;ll let you know if I ever find a good solution to syncing it with <a href="http://todotxt.com">todo.txt</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a post I ran recently at my Posterous blog, announcing my move over here. I thought I&rsquo;d put it here for reference while I finish drafting a proper post about how my personal take on blogging has evolved over the years.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Dear people who read this website,</p>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to tell you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I made a new website. It&rsquo;s located at <a href="http://joeross.me">[http://joeross.me](http://joeross.me)</a>. It is called &ldquo;By Joe Ross.&rdquo; The title may not be creative, but the content will be good.</p></li>
<li><p> I made it because <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/03/welcoming-posterous-team-to-flock.html">Twitter bought Posterous</a> in mid-March, and <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/big-news">Posterous hasn&rsquo;t said a word to its users since</a>. I trust they will give users notice before a shutdown, but TweetDeck has mostly stagnated in the wake of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/25/twitter-confirms-tweetdeck-acquisition">its acquisition by Twitter</a>, and I don&rsquo;t want to keep investing my content in something that will potentially go away soon.</p></li>
<li><p> My Posterous blog, from now on, will consist only of links to new posts at my new blog.</p></li>
<li><p> My new site is a Wordpress.org installation registered via <a href="http://hover.com">Hover.com</a> and hosted (for now, at least) with <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> My new blog will focus on law and technology, and how the two intersect. There won&rsquo;t be many images, because finding images for posts has been a distraction for me and I want to focus on what I&rsquo;m saying.</p></li>
<li><p> My new blog won&rsquo;t include <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/pets">photos of my pets</a>, <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/gaming">thoughts about gaming</a> (unless there&rsquo;s a legal or new-tech angle), or <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/food">posts about food</a>. That kind of stuff will live at <a href="http://joeross.tumblr.com">my Tumblr</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> I will be importing relevant posts from my Posterous blog to my new blog over the next several weeks. I won&rsquo;t post links to those on the Posterous, since that&rsquo;s where they came from.</p></li>
<li><p> I will maintain my Posterous blog for as long as Posterous maintains their service.</p></li>
<li><p> There are at least thirty folks subscribed to my Posterous blog&rsquo;s RSS feed. Thanks for that! But my new feed is <a href="http://joeross.me/feed">here</a>, so update your reader. The feed will remain full-content.</p></li>
<li><p>. I&rsquo;m excited to write more during the summer due to a lighter course load, and I hope you like the new site.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Joe</p>

> The North Carolina amendment alters the constitution to say that &#8220;marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized&#8221; in the state.

</blockquote>


<p>&mdash;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/politics/north-carolina-marriage/">CNN</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t often take a preachy tone, and this story has little to do with how the law and technology intersect, which is my usual topic on this website. However, I think people should be treated the same, and when they&rsquo;re not, I get angry. When masses of people vote for something so clearly despicable that it can accurately be called <em>evil</em>, I have to get my thoughts about it out of my system.</p>

<p>And my thoughts about North Carolina&rsquo;s ban on same-sex marriage are the following:</p>

<p>One day, the descendants of the 61% of North Carolinians who voted discrimination into their constitution today will look back on what their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents did on Tuesday, May 8, 2012 with disgust, much the same way we do when we read the state&rsquo;s <a href="http://think-progress.tumblr.com/post/22691147682/the-last-time-north-carolina-amended-their">nonchalant 1875 ban on interracial marriage</a>.</p>

<p>To the 39% of folks in North Carolina who voted with morals, ethics, and plain old common sense:</p>

<p>I implore you, for the sake of your children, to leave your state. Seek refuge from those among your neighbors who would so blight the wonder of democracy.</p>

<p><em>You</em> are the 39%, who refused to institutionalize hate, to legalize discrimination, to dress up ignorance in the guise of religion, or to use family as a pretext for subjugating a minority. Be proud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I wrote the article below for Temple Law&rsquo;s student newspaper, Prima Facie. While my views on the topic of copyright liability in the modern Internet&rsquo;s &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo; continue to evolve, I haven&rsquo;t made any edits to the version that ran in Prima&rsquo;s April issue. This is a long post, but I would welcome any feedback, including criticism as long as it&rsquo;s constructive. I also include a postscript at the bottom mentioning a recent development that may affect the relevant legal landscape.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Fair use doctrine is a great thing. Its allows limited use of copyrighted works and consists of four factors. Those factors include the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the work used, the amount used relative to the whole work, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the work. These considerations, developed at common law and now included in the Copyright Act at 17 USC § 107, can be powerful tools for art, education, and other endeavors. But they are also widely misunderstood. Copyright law and fair use are in many ways more important than ever. </p>

<p>Ours is an increasingly networked world, marked by everyday activities like sharing things on Facebook and posting things to blogs. The rise of social engagement and the sharing economy has been so meteoric as to pull even the enterprise into its gravitational field. The largest companies in the world are now active on Twitter, and even the late Steve Jobs made his Apple, Inc. email address publicly known, sometimes even sending personal replies to complete strangers.</p>

<p>This is an exciting development, and harbors many of the hallmarks of what early pioneers of the public internet might call “success.” And they would be right. But the internet is a tool, and like any tool, it is only as good or as evil as the people who use it. The internet is used to spread child pornography, to pirate movies and music, and to steal massive amounts of credit card and other sensitive private information. However, somewhere between the glorious interconnection that let frustrated Apple users get the low-down from Mr. Jobs himself, and the internet’s criminal underground, there are more pedestrian, though no less important, issues for us to face.</p>

<p>Issues like Pinterest.com. Well, Pinterest isn’t the issue, the issue is still copyright law and the confusion it often causes when it comes to the internet. Legislation like 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act tries to minimize the liability of service providers for the digital wrongs committed by their users. But those laws don’t (and probably shouldn’t) take similar steps to relieve the users themselves of liability for things like copyright infringement. And therein lies the complication for Pinterest. </p>

<p>The invite-only image sharing site had 11.7 million unique visitors in January 2012, according to web metrics firm comScore. Users keep an eye out for interesting or beautiful images while they’re shopping, reading news, or otherwise surfing the web. When they find something worth bookmarking, they “pin” it, building “boards” based on different topics. Earlier this year, attorney and photographer Kirsten Kowalski wrote a blog post about her misgivings: it looked to her like Pinterest users were engaging in copyright infringement on a scale never before seen. Pinterest, the internet seemed to say in unison, has a very big copyright problem.</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, it’s not really Pinterest’s copyright problem. It’s Pinterest’s users copyright problem, since the DMCA and a well-worded indemnification clause in their terms of service probably get Pinterest themselves off the hook. But the problem with Kowalski’s post, and with the press and viral internet attention it got, is that the “Pinterest problem” is absolutely not on a scale never before seen. This is, in fact, how the internet works. The compliance with the DMCA and solid indemnification clauses keep companies out of hot copyright water, but users are infringing at an astounding daily rate. </p>

<p>The popular blogging service Tumblr gets around twelve billion monthly pageviews. Just Google “tumblr star wars” to get a feel for how much user infringement is going on over there. Sections 9 and 10 of Tumblr&rsquo;s terms of service give them the same indemnity from claims and judgments related to use of the service that Pinterest demands. That’s because Tumblr, Facebook, and others have been around for years, doing exactly what Pinterest does: enabling (and often profiting, directly or indirectly, from) infringement. Publishers often let it go because the traffic and mindshare they derive from this rampant sharing is more valuable to them than the hunt-and-peck game of suing individual infringers. In reality, users agree to assume massive liability in return for the use of myriad blogging services every day, and they have been for a very, very long time. </p>

<p>Pinterest has developed a snippet of website code they refer to as a “nopin” tag that copyright owners can include on their own websites to block Pinterest users from displaying their content via Pinterest. It’s a gesture of goodwill from Pinterest to rights holders, and popular photo sharing site Flickr has made the “nopin” tag an option for its own copyright-holding users. But there’s a better way to empower users to share than mere reliance on the continued laissez-faire legal strategies of publishers and ad hoc website tags.</p>

<p>This brings us back to fair use, the doctrine mentioned at the beginning of this article. Many misconstrue fair use as a right to use someone else’s work regardless of copyright. That’s not what it is at all, though. It is an affirmative defense, only marshaled when a defendant essentially admits to infringing a §106 right. You admit the infringement, but then assert a fair use defense. Under current law, fair use never &ldquo;excuses&rdquo; or &ldquo;permits&rdquo; infringement ex ante.</p>

<p>But maybe it should.</p>

<p>Maybe copyright law should be modified to make fair use an <em>a priori</em> right of the public to use, with certain limitations and restrictions, the copyrighted works of others. That doesn’t mean that Pinterest users would be off the hook, and commercial companies running their own Pinterest boards will always be more likely to draw negative attention from rights holders in copyright as well as trademark and “use of likeness” issues. Users are required to comply with current law.</p>

<p>But fair use as a right instead of an affirmative defense would reduce the chilling effect overbroad copyright law sometimes has, and would facilitate the growth of the sharing economy that has come to define the modern internet.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript:</strong><em> Porn publisher Perfect 10 has sued Tumblr over the many copies of its copyrighted photos the blogging service allegedly stores on its servers. Note that they&rsquo;re not suing Pinterest, despite its recent surge in popularity. As I said, what many call the &ldquo;Pinterest problem&rdquo; predates Pinterest, and as today&rsquo;s news suggests, it might be more aptly termed the &ldquo;Tumblr problem.&rdquo; Read Jeff John Roberts&#8217; <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/05/07/exclusive-publisher-sues-tumblr-over-porn-pics/">post at paidContent</a> for more information.</em></p>

<p>No way.</p>

<p>The only source of pressure on Apple to do anything is the company&rsquo;s own design language and direction. If they ever made iPhones with larger screens, it would be for their own reasons, like maybe the retina display deserves a slightly larger screen on which to show off its awesomeness.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s already the iPad for that.</p>

<p>It <em>won&rsquo;t</em> <strong>ever</strong> be to reach &ldquo;lower-cost segments&rdquo; like another analyst told Yang, because Apple&rsquo;s strategy for that is to slice the price of older iPhone models to the bone whenever a new one comes out. <em>There&rsquo;s</em> your lower-cost segment. They&rsquo;ve been doing it for some time now, with narry a > 3.5 inch screen in sight.</p>

<p>This is good news. I can keep paying $5 per year for 20 GB instead of the $2.50 per month ($30 per year) for 25 GB that new <a href="https://drive.google.com/start#home">Google Drive</a> users will pay.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/04/18/twitter-patent-agreement"><strong>Twitter’s “Innovator’s Patent Agreement” – Marco.org »</strong></a></p>

<p>I <a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/17/twitter-wont-use-employee-patents-offensively/">recently wrote</a> about <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/04/introducing-innovators-patent-agreement.html">Twitter&rsquo;s promise</a> to use patents only for defensive purposes&mdash;the &ldquo;Innovator&rsquo;s Patent Agreement&rdquo; (&ldquo;IPA,&rdquo; not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Pale_Ale">this</a>). The link above leads to a post by Marco Arment, warning us to read the agreement carefully and maintain a healthy skepticism about the potential loopholes in Twitter&rsquo;s recent patent move. It&rsquo;s a fair warning, and a good point.</p>

<p>Nilay Patel made brief mention over at <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2955035/twitter-introduces-innovators-patent-agreemeent"><em>The Verge</em></a> of the &ldquo;fair amount of flexibility&rdquo; the agreement leaves for Twitter. But Arment really lays out the manner in which Twitter could, if necessary for business reasons, make an end-run around the whole thing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they would do that. If they wanted the option to sneak through loopholes, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been so attention-seeking with the IPA announcement in the first place.</p>

<p>This is exactly what has me seriously considering something even more &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; than <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress.org</a> for my post-Posterous blog. Right now, I&rsquo;m looking at <a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogr.am</a>, and it&rsquo;s very promising. Write posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, save to <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, and Scriptogr.am turns them into HTML. Scriptogr.am even has a bookmarklet, just like Posterous, Wordpress and the rest.</p>
