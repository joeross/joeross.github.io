  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t know anything about design. I&rsquo;m a user, and design work on websites made for frequent article consumption should be tailored to user experience. I may come off as arrogant, ignorant, or petty. That&rsquo;s not my intention. I&rsquo;m being honest about my thoughts.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Engadget has launched a full re-design, something we&rsquo;ve seen recently with sites like <a href="http://thenextweb.com"><em>The Next Web</em></a> and <a href="http://readwrite.com"><em>Read Write</em></a>. Like those, Engadget&rsquo;s new look focuses on cross-platform responsiveness, with a bias for tablets. I don&rsquo;t write about every redesign I see, but Engadget was the first blog I read with dedication, so it has a special place in my geek heart.</p>

<p>Engadget&rsquo;s previous design was, as even <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/">Editor-in-Chief Tim Stevens puts it</a>, &ldquo;heavy.&rdquo; A better description would be clunky, crufty, and stale. I&rsquo;m only going to mention a few details that are very important to me, instead of describing to you a website that you can just go see for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>TYPOGRAPHY</strong></p>

<p>The new Engadget uses the free Google Web Font <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Oswald">Oswald</a> for headlines. It feels too narrow, but Engadget is prone to information-rich headlines, so I can understand why they chose it. Full-width article images get a headline overlay on top of the image. Opacity of the overlay increases to 1 when you hover your cursor over the headline text. I wish it went to 1 on hover over the image itself, making it easier to get that readable opaque background behind the article title.</p>

<p>The body font is Georgia (same as this blog you&rsquo;re reading now). It seems almost too pedestrian for a blog of Engadget&rsquo;s means, as does the Google Web Font. After all, Engadget  has a budget and a design staff. I find it hard to believe that the best they could do font-wise was a free Google font and Georgia.</p>

<p>Then again, <a href="http://theverge.com"><em>The Verge</em></a> uses Helvetica or Arial, and <a href="http://readwrite.com"><em>Read Write</em></a> uses mere &ldquo;sans serif.&rdquo; These blogs often cater to dedicated fan bases, so page loading speed is important: many readers click between multiple articles in one sitting.</p>

<p>I wish font was larger in articles themselves. Yes, it&rsquo;s easy to increase the size of the page with a quick CMD + (or CTRL + on Windows), but I definitely consider most of the web just a little small as far as font size. People should be able to sit back and read comfortably.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me (although I&rsquo;m told my reading vision is fine), but if I have to lean forward to read a website, I&rsquo;m having a bad reading experience. This is why I&rsquo;m a frequent <a href="http://daringfireball.net"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a> reader but I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I visited the website itself.</p>

<p><strong>MENUS AND UI</strong></p>

<p>I like the topics bar at the top of the site and the placement of the search field immediately beneath it. Expand the &ldquo;Topics&rdquo; item on the far right of the top bar to reveal more specific categories. The spacing is touch target friendly, and I appreciate the lack of some fancy separator character.</p>

<p>I like the banner at the top of the site. I like the loading bar that shows the time-to-change from one featured story to the next. I like the persistent table of contents on longer articles, like the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/">redesign announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Share buttons are well-placed on both the front page and article pages. Pinterest is an interesting addition to sharing options and one that I don&rsquo;t see very often on sites of Engadget&rsquo;s type. I occasionally dive into Pinterest myself to pepper my friends with gadget posts. Maybe Engadget can read my mind…</p>

<p>Probably not, though, otherwise the &ldquo;Via&rdquo; and &ldquo;Source&rdquo; links would be internalized instead of placed in article footers. I don&rsquo;t go to Engadget because I think they break <em>every</em> tech news story ever, I go because their opinions on the news interest me. Thus, in-line source linking wouldn&rsquo;t risk losing me to the source. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m the exception or the rule, but something about placing source links in the footer has always bugged me.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like the sidebar with the headline-over-dimmed-image motif. It works in the main body of the site, but in the sidebar it&rsquo;s cluttered and incredibly difficult to scan. I want to see &ldquo;Recent Reviews&rdquo; and other site content placed above links to the podcasts and other supplementary media. The &ldquo;Quoted&rdquo; section includes recent tweets from Engadget authors, but I think this space would be better used for pull-quotes from high-traffic or recent articles.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Engadget&rsquo;s new design is an improvement over the old one, and they plan still more changes as they settle into the new look. Generally, I think their design direction and that of the big-name tech blogs as a whole is great. Tablet-optimized design built for fingertips instead of cursors leads to less clutter and more negative space. In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, that aesthetic tracks well with my own preferences, so it&rsquo;s encouraging to me and hope it continues. I know these websites are businesses, but at the end of the day the reading experience is absolutely everything, and if things continue down this path, I expect to see even more improvements in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Siegler found the Surface very wanting, but this bit from his intro is the most damning part of his review.</p>

<p>David Post, writing at <em>The Volokh Conspiracy</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> The Report proposes a series of rather radical — in the Jeffersonian sense — reforms, from dramatically shortening the copyright term (a no-brainer, actually) to expanding fair use and limiting the damages from infringement claims.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>The report&rsquo;s recommendations don&rsquo;t go quite as far as my suggestion that <a href="http://joeross.me/post/28065827946/the-pinterest-er-tumblr-problem-fair-use-and-a">fair use should be assumed rather than merely an affirmative defense</a>, but Professor Post is right to highlight the opportunity for the GOP to differentiate on this issue.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure there is much in there with which I would disagree, excepting the over-the-top (and even italicized) final sentence of the report&rsquo;s conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Current copyright law does not merely distort some markets – rather it destroys entire markets.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>That&rsquo;s wrong. The current US copyright regime limits access, hinders creativity, and dampens innovation, thereby frustrating copyright&rsquo;s Constitutional purpose. That fact, and I do consider it a fact, must be the foundation of the copyright reform we need in this country.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very good deal for Google, especially because they don&rsquo;t need to admit liability. It&rsquo;s a decent deal from the FTC&rsquo;s perspective, as well, because it&rsquo;s (sadly) the largest fine they&rsquo;ve ever levied in this context. I&rsquo;m not sure how effective it&rsquo;s going to be, but if you&rsquo;re unnerved by Google&rsquo;s privacy issues, there&rsquo;s always <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8993-the-cloud/">Streaming music to listeners, but not money to artists</a></p>

<p>Galaxie 500 drummer Damon Krukowski<a href="p35844181348-1">1</a>, writing at <em>Pitchfork</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Since we own our own recordings, by my calculation it would take songwriting royalties for roughly 312,000 plays on Pandora to earn us the profit of one&#8211; one&#8211; LP sale. (On Spotify, one LP is equivalent to 47,680 plays.)
>

</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;m a happy user of <a href="http://www.rdio.com">Rdio</a>, which is Spotify&rsquo;s primary competitor. My fiancée and I pay $17.99 per month for Rdio&rsquo;s unlimited streaming and downloading to our phones. At first glance, Mr. Krukowski&rsquo;s article calls the morality of that set-up into question, particularly for someone who wishes he could make a living on <a href="http://joeross.bandcamp.com">his own music</a>.</p>

<p>Some streaming subscribers probably buy more records than non-streamers as a result of discovering new musicians or getting so attached to a record that streaming it just isn&rsquo;t enough. But Mr. Krukowski casts serious doubt on the idea that streaming can, in any way meaningful to artists, replace the CD/vinyl/iTunes mode of music distribution.</p>
