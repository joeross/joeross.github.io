  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-04/google-fights-u-s-national-security-probe-data-demand.html">Google fighting National Security Letter</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">The letters</a>, issued by federal authorities investigating national security concerns, prohibit recipients from disclosing that they have received them, let alone what they&rsquo;re asking for. The Judge in Google&rsquo;s case<a href="p47208273173-1">1</a> struck down the law&rsquo;s gag order provision as violative of the First Amendment, but has stayed the effect of that decision while the government pursues an appeal.</p>

<p>I should note that I essentially paraphrased the Wikipedia article for that second sentence, as my knowledge of NSLs is limited. I look forward to reading more on them, and I&rsquo;m glad to see a company with the clout and caliber of attorneys that Google has questioning the legality of the NSL framework.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem odd that a company that siphons so much data about its users would be so protective of it when the government is asking for it.</p>

<p>But it makes sense for Google to defend user information: it needs that information to make its advertising products more relevant, Many accept the trade of having their documents and emails scanned and anonymized by Google in exchange for exceptional and <em>free</em> services. If Google fails to protect that information from surveillance via legal tools of questionable constitutionality, the balance of that trade may tip too far for many users.</p>

<p>Thus, this is one of those rare cases where corporate goals and user concerns are aligned.</p>

<p>Interesting news, but someone call the design police: there&rsquo;s a crime being committed at every Bloomberg terminal on Wall Street. It&rsquo;s 2013 and it looks like financial professionals are daily being punished with truly awful interface design. Don&rsquo;t believe me? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5RiGpqzZ2g">See for yourself</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally posted this to one of my old blogs, The Rotten Word, in <a href="http://www.therottenword.com/2009/04/why-i-chose-temple-law.html">April 2009</a>. I wanted to publish it here as well because I plan to write a follow-up soon, having graduated in January of this year. Many thanks to Philadelphia litigator Max Kennerly for his <a href="http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2009/04/articles/the-law/for-law-students/why-i-choose-temple-law-some-advice-for-an-incoming-law-student/">advice and kind words</a> about this post when it first ran. Also, <a href="http://phillygrrl.com/2009/06/25/if-youre-going-to-temple-law/">this post</a> by my Temple law classmate and friend Kishwer Vikaas Barrica was humbling, so thanks to her too!</em></p>

<h2>In the Beginning…</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a choice easily made. First of all, just the decision to take the <a href="http://www.lsac.org/">LSAT</a> is a journey in itself. It requires research, asking the right questions of the right people, preparing for failure and, perhaps most importantly, preparing for success.
It&rsquo;s the success that can be most confusing. After all, if you do poorly on the test the first time, you resolve that you probably didn&rsquo;t take it seriously enough, or that it was just a bad day. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; feel to it. The first time I took the LSAT, my score was <em>embarrassing</em>. The only saving grace was that the average friend and family member has never had any reason to learn the how the test is scored, so they don&rsquo;t know how poorly I did.</p>

<p>I could have gotten off the train right there. I almost did. I almost decided that maybe it isn&rsquo;t meant to be. But then I thought about it, and remembered that I don&rsquo;t think <em>anything</em> is meant to be. That&rsquo;s the great liberating foundation of my personal moral value system: freedom at the cost of accountability. Things happen to me because (a) I have made a decision that caused them or (b) someone else has made a decision that caused them. Thus, I can <em>decide</em> that I&rsquo;m not cut out for lawyering, or I can decide that I am, and then act.</p>

<p>So I took it again. And I did better. <em>Much</em> better. Suffice it to say that I am no longer embarrassed, even by my first score, because my second vindicated me. I studied harder, focused more deliberately, and made executive decisions about which questions I could answer well and which ones I could not.</p>

<p>But getting a score you can respect yourself for is only the beginning.</p>

<h2>Decisions, Decisions</h2>

<p>Will you devote all of your time to your studies, subsidizing your living expenses as well as the cost of your education? Or will you retain your current employment, making the (in my opinion) far more daunting commitment to maintain your financial standing and continue to accrue work experience while you submit to the rigor of a legal education?</p>

<p>On the one hand, going to school full time looks like the most sensible decision. Everything you have heard about law school is true: it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em>. It&rsquo;s not an afterthought, or a hobby. It&rsquo;s at <em>least</em> as mentally stressful as your job, and probably more. Like any graduate school, every hour of class time requires at least an hour outside the classroom. So, the ability to go to class all day and devote your evenings to study and work is a precious resource.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the economy is (still) bad, and even if previously borrowed loans are deferred while you are in graduate school, there are bills and rent to be paid, not to mention food and (dare I say) the occasional drink. Borrowing money for these expenditures is inadvisable at best. Working through law school is difficult, but, since the evening division is a part-time program, credit requirements are flexible: you must complete a certain amount, but you have summer sessions during which you can earn credit, as well. You can keep earning money, and producing promotable deliverables. But you&rsquo;ll be spending a few hours a night, a few nights a week, in a classroom. And that&rsquo;s before you even start your homework. It may be a part-time education, but it&rsquo;s a second full-time job.</p>

<h2>So why did I choose Temple Law?</h2>

<p>Well, even taking into account the (generous) aid package Drexel offered me, I would have had to borrow more money to cover living expenses than I&rsquo;ll likely need to borrow to go to Temple. Also, my 401(k) account makes me smile, and cutting it off for a few years would mean less smiles. Finally, I&rsquo;ve got a good thing going at my current job: good work, good people, good benefits. These are not things to be taken lightly in today&rsquo;s job market. For every lawyer making $80k right out of school, there are three more at the unemployment office. And we&rsquo;re talking <em>partners</em> here. People with <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>I made the commitment to work and go to school at the same time. I want to be confident about it, even arrogant. But the truth is that it&rsquo;s terrifying. After all, I might not be able to do it. Then what? I don&rsquo;t know. But I know that it&rsquo;s what I want, and people do it every day. People with more stressful jobs, people with children. There are really no excuses.</p>

<p>Classes are technically from 6pm to 10pm. I&rsquo;m going to be in danger of succumbing to my burgeoning caffeine addiction. I&rsquo;m going to be in danger of burning out. I&rsquo;m going to be in danger of driving the girlfriend (more) insane (than usual).</p>

<p>But maybe I&rsquo;ll quit caffeine and start meditating. Or running. Maybe I&rsquo;ll apply my work ethic to my studies, and develop a schedule that includes class time, study time, and mental stability time. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do well.</p>

<h2>Closing Argument</h2>

<p>This absurdly long post has served primarily as a &ldquo;thinking out loud&rdquo; session for me, in which I&rsquo;ve tried to express what has been going on in my head as I near the next and most important part of my journey: actually going to law school. But this is the tip of the iceberg. This stuff takes me away mid-conversation at work, puts blank stares on my face while Meg&rsquo;s talking to me, and keeps me wide awake in bed. It worries me, aggravates me, <em>scares me</em>. This is the stuff I always thought adults had to deal with, the stuff that I got to watch other people figure out while I wrote stories or played my guitar.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m one of those people. I have a job, investments, credit cards, an actual (and good) credit score. I don&rsquo;t think I could afford to work a side job and go to school. So it might take me longer to finish, while I take fewer classes. But my sense of financial security is young and, with the exception of some indinspensable help (for which I&rsquo;ll always be grateful), largely self-wrought. Risking it doesn&rsquo;t seem right. So wish me luck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to need it.</p>

<p>Zack Shapiro offers some great advice for those interested in learning to code <em>as a means to build something</em>. I&rsquo;m one of those people he mentions who are using <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a> but I make it a part of my weekly routine and it&rsquo;s helping.</p>

<p>I wrote a post <a href="http://joeross.me/post/28065837003/code-as-perspective">almost a year ago</a> about how code relates to the law, and I stand by it: it&rsquo;s a great way of learning to think critically. Even if you don&rsquo;t learn to build what you have in mind, you&rsquo;ll get some useful lessons out of the experience.</p>

<p>The Second Circuit has held in <em>WNET v Aereo</em> (<a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/2a55b1d7-8f1b-46df-9a0d-82d36c31ed06/1/doc/12-2786_12-2807_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/2a55b1d7-8f1b-46df-9a0d-82d36c31ed06/1/hilite/">PDF</a>) that sending a unique stream of over-the-air TV signal to customers via the internet isn&rsquo;t a copyright violation.</p>

<p>Aereo assign each of its subscribers their own personal antenna and stream to comply with a previous Second Circuit decision. In other words, Aereo could provide its service with one antenna, but it needs to use one for every subscriber. The use of one antenna for <em>all</em> subscribers, as the Second Circuit held in its <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13763893657469687275&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">2008 <em>Cablevision</em> opinion</a>, would likely constitute an unlawful public performance.</p>

<p>Judge Chin says in his dissent that he isn&rsquo;t pleased by this technique:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Aereo&#8217;s &#8220;technology platform&#8221; is, however, a sham. The system employs thousands of individual dime-sized antennas, but there is no technologically sound reason to use a multitude of tiny individual antennas rather than one central antenna; indeed, the system is a Rube Goldberg-like contrivance, over-engineered in an attempt to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act and to take advantage of a perceived loophole in the law.

<p>Aereo&rsquo;s technology isn&rsquo;t an attempt to avoid the reach of the Act. It&rsquo;s an attempt to comply with the Second Circuit&rsquo;s own characterization of the Act&rsquo;s meaning and purpose. The absurdity of the situation arises not from Aereo&rsquo;s attempt at a &ldquo;sham,&rdquo; but from the outdated Copyright Act itself.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the rest of Judge Chen&rsquo;s dissent suggests he may make some reasonable points distinguishing Aereo from the DVR service at issue in <em>Cablevision</em>, so I&rsquo;ll withhold my own final thoughts on this case until I&rsquo;ve read the Aereo opinion through.</p>

<p>But copyright law needs fixing. It was written during a time when the cost of copying was non-trivial, and copies were typically finite and controlled centrally by the rightsholder. There is no longer any non-trivial cost to copying. Whether between servers or from a server to your computer, the internet is nothing more or less than a giant copy-making machine. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to weaken copyright law (although shorter terms would be more in line with copyright&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause">Constitutional imperative</a>), but we do need to adapt it to the modern world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323419104578376042379430724-lMyQjAxMTAzMDMwMTEzNDEyWj.html">China is very serious about cyberespionage</a></p>

<p>Google apologists like myself often answer concerns that the search-and-advertising giant can scan your email with something like &ldquo;yes, but they&rsquo;re doing it with robots and scrubbing it clean of all identifying information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>China, however, is not so concerned with your privacy or its own image. In fact, monitoring otherwise-harmless civilians probably proves valuable to the renegade nation by illustrating the best means of tricking US netizens into installing backdoor viruses on their systems.</p>

<p>The most important point this article makes, in my view, is that China is playing the long game on cyberespionage efforts. As David Feith reports in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> piece linked to above:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> The essence of China&#8217;s thinking about cyber warfare is the concept of shi, he says, first introduced in Sun Tzu&#8217;s &#8220;The Art of War&#8221; about 2,500 years ago. The concept&#8217;s English translation is debated, but Mr. Thomas subscribes to the rendering of Chinese Gen. Tao Hanzhang, who defines shi as &#8220;the strategically advantageous posture before a battle.&#8221;
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>They&rsquo;re not going to take down any infrastructure any time soon, but if and when they want to, their current efforts will probably go a long way to helping them learn how to do it.</p>

<p>This stuff is not just a headline: it&rsquo;s been happening for some time, is still happening, and is likely only to increase. Mr. Feith&rsquo;s article at the <em>Journal</em> is well worth reading.</p>
