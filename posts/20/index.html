<p>Attorney Michael C. Sullivan, representing California schools in a spate of fraud suits brought by students over shady job-placement numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> &#8220;What I find most ironic is that those individuals advertised themselves to law schools as great critical thinkers,&#8221; Sullivan said of the law-grads-turned-litigants. &#8220;Now they say they never considered the possibility that employment might include part-time jobs.&#8221;
>

</blockquote>


<p>Mr. Sullivan&rsquo;s statement is ludicrous. The <em>students</em> pay, so the <em>schools</em> market. His clients, if the allegations prove true, <em>marketed</em> themselves as producers of very employable law graduates. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that when a <em>law</em> school shares post-graduation employment rates, the <em>law</em> school is referring to <em>legal</em> employment.</p>

<p>My incredulity at Mr. Sullivan&rsquo;s absurd position does not mean that I&rsquo;m ignorant of the fact that many students didn&rsquo;t try very hard to get a job, or didn&rsquo;t like the jobs they got, or should have known the market for legal jobs is, to put it mildly, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-the-job-market-for-law-school-grads-crumbled-and-how-it-could-come-back-to-life/272852/">in dire straits</a>, and has been for some time now.</p>

<p>In fact, I have little sympathy for people swindled by Mr. Sullivan&rsquo;s clients&#8217; number games. Just search <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=legal%20job%20market&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=efeab37813788df6&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44697112,d.dmQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=994">&ldquo;legal job market&rdquo;</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=should+i+go+to+law+school&amp;oq=should+i+go+to+&amp;gs_l=serp.3.0.0i20l2j0l2.67820.69234.0.69984.15.10.0.5.5.1.209.1110.3j6j1.10.0...0.0...1c.1.8.psy-ab.OyX-TrOxxi8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=efeab37813788df6&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=994&amp;ion=1">&ldquo;should I go to law school?&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>I knew when I signed up for law school in 2009 that things were not going well for recent graduates, and that they were not expected to recover before I graduated. I went anyway because I want to be an attorney. Never do something that requires years of your life and tens of thousands of dollars without doing your research.</p>

<p>Due diligence is too strong a phrase for it: it&rsquo;s common sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can live here,&rdquo; Apple seems to say to developers, &ldquo;but if you ever break one of our vague rules, or if we ever decide for any reason or even for no reason at all that you must go, you will be evicted. No appeal, no questions asked, no discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wish only the best to the folks at AppGratis, but this is the danger in building your business, and your employees&#8217; livelihoods, on something over which you have absolutely no control.</p>

<p>YouTube&rsquo;s well within their rights to refuse to leave a video up, or to re-post it after fair use has been reasonably well-defended. But it&rsquo;s another reminder that when stuff is free for consumers, the interests of the producers providing the content will always take precedence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-04/google-fights-u-s-national-security-probe-data-demand.html">Google fighting National Security Letter</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">The letters</a>, issued by federal authorities investigating national security concerns, prohibit recipients from disclosing that they have received them, let alone what they&rsquo;re asking for. The Judge in Google&rsquo;s case<a href="p47208273173-1">1</a> struck down the law&rsquo;s gag order provision as violative of the First Amendment, but has stayed the effect of that decision while the government pursues an appeal.</p>

<p>I should note that I essentially paraphrased the Wikipedia article for that second sentence, as my knowledge of NSLs is limited. I look forward to reading more on them, and I&rsquo;m glad to see a company with the clout and caliber of attorneys that Google has questioning the legality of the NSL framework.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem odd that a company that siphons so much data about its users would be so protective of it when the government is asking for it.</p>

<p>But it makes sense for Google to defend user information: it needs that information to make its advertising products more relevant, Many accept the trade of having their documents and emails scanned and anonymized by Google in exchange for exceptional and <em>free</em> services. If Google fails to protect that information from surveillance via legal tools of questionable constitutionality, the balance of that trade may tip too far for many users.</p>

<p>Thus, this is one of those rare cases where corporate goals and user concerns are aligned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally posted this to one of my old blogs, The Rotten Word, in <a href="http://www.therottenword.com/2009/04/why-i-chose-temple-law.html">April 2009</a>. I wanted to publish it here as well because I plan to write a follow-up soon, having graduated in January of this year. Many thanks to Philadelphia litigator Max Kennerly for his <a href="http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2009/04/articles/the-law/for-law-students/why-i-choose-temple-law-some-advice-for-an-incoming-law-student/">advice and kind words</a> about this post when it first ran. Also, <a href="http://phillygrrl.com/2009/06/25/if-youre-going-to-temple-law/">this post</a> by my Temple law classmate and friend Kishwer Vikaas Barrica was humbling, so thanks to her too!</em></p>

<h2>In the Beginning…</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a choice easily made. First of all, just the decision to take the <a href="http://www.lsac.org/">LSAT</a> is a journey in itself. It requires research, asking the right questions of the right people, preparing for failure and, perhaps most importantly, preparing for success.
It&rsquo;s the success that can be most confusing. After all, if you do poorly on the test the first time, you resolve that you probably didn&rsquo;t take it seriously enough, or that it was just a bad day. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; feel to it. The first time I took the LSAT, my score was <em>embarrassing</em>. The only saving grace was that the average friend and family member has never had any reason to learn the how the test is scored, so they don&rsquo;t know how poorly I did.</p>

<p>I could have gotten off the train right there. I almost did. I almost decided that maybe it isn&rsquo;t meant to be. But then I thought about it, and remembered that I don&rsquo;t think <em>anything</em> is meant to be. That&rsquo;s the great liberating foundation of my personal moral value system: freedom at the cost of accountability. Things happen to me because (a) I have made a decision that caused them or (b) someone else has made a decision that caused them. Thus, I can <em>decide</em> that I&rsquo;m not cut out for lawyering, or I can decide that I am, and then act.</p>

<p>So I took it again. And I did better. <em>Much</em> better. Suffice it to say that I am no longer embarrassed, even by my first score, because my second vindicated me. I studied harder, focused more deliberately, and made executive decisions about which questions I could answer well and which ones I could not.</p>

<p>But getting a score you can respect yourself for is only the beginning.</p>

<h2>Decisions, Decisions</h2>

<p>Will you devote all of your time to your studies, subsidizing your living expenses as well as the cost of your education? Or will you retain your current employment, making the (in my opinion) far more daunting commitment to maintain your financial standing and continue to accrue work experience while you submit to the rigor of a legal education?</p>

<p>On the one hand, going to school full time looks like the most sensible decision. Everything you have heard about law school is true: it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em>. It&rsquo;s not an afterthought, or a hobby. It&rsquo;s at <em>least</em> as mentally stressful as your job, and probably more. Like any graduate school, every hour of class time requires at least an hour outside the classroom. So, the ability to go to class all day and devote your evenings to study and work is a precious resource.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the economy is (still) bad, and even if previously borrowed loans are deferred while you are in graduate school, there are bills and rent to be paid, not to mention food and (dare I say) the occasional drink. Borrowing money for these expenditures is inadvisable at best. Working through law school is difficult, but, since the evening division is a part-time program, credit requirements are flexible: you must complete a certain amount, but you have summer sessions during which you can earn credit, as well. You can keep earning money, and producing promotable deliverables. But you&rsquo;ll be spending a few hours a night, a few nights a week, in a classroom. And that&rsquo;s before you even start your homework. It may be a part-time education, but it&rsquo;s a second full-time job.</p>

<h2>So why did I choose Temple Law?</h2>

<p>Well, even taking into account the (generous) aid package Drexel offered me, I would have had to borrow more money to cover living expenses than I&rsquo;ll likely need to borrow to go to Temple. Also, my 401(k) account makes me smile, and cutting it off for a few years would mean less smiles. Finally, I&rsquo;ve got a good thing going at my current job: good work, good people, good benefits. These are not things to be taken lightly in today&rsquo;s job market. For every lawyer making $80k right out of school, there are three more at the unemployment office. And we&rsquo;re talking <em>partners</em> here. People with <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>I made the commitment to work and go to school at the same time. I want to be confident about it, even arrogant. But the truth is that it&rsquo;s terrifying. After all, I might not be able to do it. Then what? I don&rsquo;t know. But I know that it&rsquo;s what I want, and people do it every day. People with more stressful jobs, people with children. There are really no excuses.</p>

<p>Classes are technically from 6pm to 10pm. I&rsquo;m going to be in danger of succumbing to my burgeoning caffeine addiction. I&rsquo;m going to be in danger of burning out. I&rsquo;m going to be in danger of driving the girlfriend (more) insane (than usual).</p>

<p>But maybe I&rsquo;ll quit caffeine and start meditating. Or running. Maybe I&rsquo;ll apply my work ethic to my studies, and develop a schedule that includes class time, study time, and mental stability time. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do well.</p>

<h2>Closing Argument</h2>

<p>This absurdly long post has served primarily as a &ldquo;thinking out loud&rdquo; session for me, in which I&rsquo;ve tried to express what has been going on in my head as I near the next and most important part of my journey: actually going to law school. But this is the tip of the iceberg. This stuff takes me away mid-conversation at work, puts blank stares on my face while Meg&rsquo;s talking to me, and keeps me wide awake in bed. It worries me, aggravates me, <em>scares me</em>. This is the stuff I always thought adults had to deal with, the stuff that I got to watch other people figure out while I wrote stories or played my guitar.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m one of those people. I have a job, investments, credit cards, an actual (and good) credit score. I don&rsquo;t think I could afford to work a side job and go to school. So it might take me longer to finish, while I take fewer classes. But my sense of financial security is young and, with the exception of some indinspensable help (for which I&rsquo;ll always be grateful), largely self-wrought. Risking it doesn&rsquo;t seem right. So wish me luck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to need it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.zackshapiro.com/want-to-learn-to-code-start-here?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:%20svbtle%20(Svbtle%20Featured">Want to learn to code? Start here.</a>)</p>

<p>Zack Shapiro offers some great advice for those interested in learning to code <em>as a means to build something</em>. I&rsquo;m one of those people he mentions who are using <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a> but I make it a part of my weekly routine and it&rsquo;s helping.</p>

<p>I wrote a post <a href="http://joeross.me/post/28065837003/code-as-perspective">almost a year ago</a> about how code relates to the law, and I stand by it: it&rsquo;s a great way of learning to think critically. Even if you don&rsquo;t learn to build what you have in mind, you&rsquo;ll get some useful lessons out of the experience.</p>
