  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.volokh.com/2012/10/18/first-amendment-alive-and-well-in-nebraska/">Nebraska court strikes down restrictions on internet use for sex offenders on free speech grounds</a></p>

<p>Professor David Post of Temple Law served as an expert for the plaintiffs &mdash; yes, sex offenders &mdash; in this case. His focus, as he points out in his <em>Volokh Conspiracy</em> post, was on the overbroad nature of the statute barring internet use by sex offenders, which he believes, and the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">United States District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> agreed, was beyond what the First Amendment allows.</p>

<p>Your first thought might be &ldquo;who cares about a sex offender&rsquo;s free speech rights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that the Constitution cares, particularly after they have served prison time and otherwise complied with constitutionally sound penalties for their crimes.</p>

<p>The core of the court&rsquo;s holding lies in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> The ban not only restricts the exchange of text between adults; it also restricts the exchange of oral and video communication between adults. Moreover, the ban potentially restricts the targeted offenders from communicating with hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of adults and their companies despite the fact that the communication has nothing whatsoever to do with minors.[1](p33905230393-1)
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>This looks to me like a well-meaning statute, meant to keep sex offenders away from kids online, that was very poorly drafted. You could achieve the desired goal using far narrower provisions. I hope someone proposes a corrected statute to that effect.</p>

<p>The decision, filed on October 17, is not yet &ldquo;reported,&rdquo; but it can be accessed by those with Westlaw access using the cite <em>Doe v. Nebraska</em>, 8:09CV456, 2012 WL 4923131 (D. Neb. 2012), and Professor Post also uploaded a PDF <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/110371905/Sora-Order-121017">here</a>. <a href="p33905230393-1">↩</a></p>

<p>Carlos Fernando Lindenberg Neto, president of Brazil&rsquo;s National Association of Newspapers, on his association&rsquo;s withdraw from Google <a href="News:">News:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Google News’ presence in the Brazilian market is small. We believe (the loss of traffic) is an acceptable price to protect our content and brands.

</blockquote>


<p>The linked article, by Isabela Fraga at the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas blog, offers good background on the issue.</p>

<p>I never go to Google News without clicking on at least three stories I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise encountered. Maybe I&rsquo;m the exception and not the rule. But if Google News&#8217; presence is really that small, isn&rsquo;t the potential or actual harm they claim necessarily small as well?</p>

<p>This decision looks petty and short-sighted, particularly in light of <em>Newsweek</em>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/18/a-turn-of-the-page-for-newsweek.html">recent announcement</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671036/aol-might-just-have-invented-emails-next-ui-paradigm#1">Alto: Aol&rsquo;s attempt to redesign email</a></p>

<p>Austin Carr, writing at <em>Fast Company</em>&rsquo;s <em>Co.Design</em> blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> It’s actually proved to be a more modern and nimble alternative to many of its mainstream counterparts, and boasts many novel features that Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, even with its beautiful redesign of Outlook, should all heed lessons from.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>His review has some images and a really good explanation of how Alto feels. <em>Fast Company</em>&rsquo;s Adam Bluestein spoke with Alto&rsquo;s team leads, and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3001755/aols-alto-reimagines-email-experience-twitter-pinterest-gmail-mashup">that article is also worth a look</a>.</p>

<p>The articles compare Alto to Pinterest, but it looks to me more like Evernote, with note titles and summaries on the left and notebooks in a larger &ldquo;stack&rdquo; layout pane on the right. Regardless, it looks elegant and functional, which is what I want from websites and apps. I&rsquo;m really impressed by how it looks and the philosophy behind what they did, including empowering an insular team to build it outside of Aol&rsquo;s larger structure.</p>

<p>In fact, Alto looks so well-designed that, if I was in charge at Aol, I probably would have had them launch without much of a mention of Aol at all. It&rsquo;s unfortunate but true that the Aol brand is really a handicap to anyone trying to do something as bold as redesigning how we use email. Some people may see &ldquo;Alto, by Aol&rdquo; and skip it altogether. I almost did.</p>

<p>Alto works with many popular email services, including Gmail, so I&rsquo;m excited to see how it works. You can request an invite <a href="https://login.altomail.com/login/signin?next=http://altomail.com/app/main">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll write something more in-depth when I get the chance to try it out.</p>

<p>Mr. Siegler and Mr. Velazco pointed out the nine-day sales window the iPhone 5 had before these quarterly numbers were announced, but neither came right out and said what I find to be the most impressive expression of it:</p>

<p>Verizon activated over 72,000 iPhone 5s per day during the nine days ending the quarter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-appeals-court-nixes-defense-marriage-act">2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals: DOMA violates Equal Protection</a></p>

<p>Larry Neumeister, for <em>AP</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued its 2-to-1 ruling only weeks after hearing arguments on a lower court judge&#8217;s findings that the 1996 [&#8220;Defense of Marriage Act&#8221;] was unconstitutional.
> 
> 
</blockquote>


<p>This is good news. The holding was based on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intermediate_scrutiny">intermediate scrutiny</a> constitutional standard and declared DOMA violative of Equal Protection.</p>

<p>The dissent in the 2-1 decision came from Judge Chester Straub, who said &ldquo;courts should not intervene where there is a robust political debate because doing so poisons the political well, imposing a destructive anti-majoritarian constitutional ruling on a vigorous debate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is the duty of a court to intervene where legislation violates constitutional protections, and that is exactly what DOMA does with regard to same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>There is no valid argument to the contrary.</p>

<p>If the Supreme Court fails to strike this law down when it comes to them some time in the next year, and fails to confirm that our Constitution disallows discrimination with regard to who citizens <em>love</em> solely on the basis of a majoritarian religious belief, it will be the darkest legal day in my lifetime thus far.</p>

<blockquote>
  
> 
> Jack also warned of a worst-case scenario in which a worm could infect multiple devices, spreading from patient to patient, re-flashing the devices with malicious code as it foes. This code could be programmed to deliver fatal shocks to patients implanted with vulnerable implants at a scheduled time.

</blockquote>


<p>So many lives depend upon the safe operation of a device like a pacemaker, including some of my dearest family. The good news here is that the researcher who discovered the vulnerability is ready and willing to work with manufacturers to design around the security weaknesses in these devices.</p>

<p>But perhaps more importantly, what about devices that have already been implanted in patients? I hope the corrections can be made via a software update so that even current patients can receive the fixes.</p>

<p>As an aside, this technology could also be used in the cyberwarfare arena for exceptionally clandestine assassinations.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about this specific issue and the problem of cyberwarfare threats generally. My time in International Law this semester and previous courses like Cyberlaw and Cyberprivacy are coalescing in my mind into a strong area of interest, though, so I expect to follow this and similar issues closely and (hopefully) develop more substantive opinions about them over the next two months.</p>

<p><a href="http://punkave.com/">P&#8217;unk Ave</a> is a &ldquo;purpose-driven agency&rdquo; of talented Philly geeks who build websites, created <a href="http://apostrophenow.org/">their own open-source CMS</a>, and generally enjoy work that really <em>does</em> something, especially in their city and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="http://greatphillyschools.org/">GreatPhillySchools.org</a> is a well-crafted comparison engine for determining which of Philly&rsquo;s schools is the best for your child. The database covers all public, private, charter, and parochial schools. This tool helps to narrow the field, and elminate underperforming schools, empowering you to give the promising ones the attention worthy of such an important decision. Maybe I sound like I&rsquo;m writing a press release for them, but I really like their work and they <em>produce</em>.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way: I was in a lot of bands in high school and college. There were always two kinds of bands: the kids that were there for the &ldquo;scene,&rdquo; to observe and be observed, and the kids that were there for the <em>music</em>, to <em>do</em> and to <em>learn</em>.</p>

<p>P&#8217;unk Ave are the second kind of people, and that&rsquo;s why I love the stuff they do.</p>

<p>I write my articles for this site in Markdown syntax because it&rsquo;s easier to read and write. I can work with scripts and other geeky implementations when I have enough time to research how they work, but I rarely have that time. I would love a tool like the one Schechter calls for in the linked post. I hope someone takes him on the suggestion.</p>
