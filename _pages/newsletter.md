Modern Law is a newsletter I'm experimenting with. My introductory blurb for it is:

> The law, always and by design, lags behind society's fiercer debates. Modern Law is a weekly email newsletter about how it is, or isn't, catching up.

It's really hard to be sufficiently descriptive and brief at the same time. But that's why I'm trying this newsletter thing out: I write here infrequently because I don't want to half-ass anything that's meant to be comprehensive. The newsletter is designed for brevity, and that limitation makes it easier to publish.

It will only rarely include links I've already shared here on [the blog](/blog), so you can read both without enduring repetition. Give it a try, and tell all your friends.
