Hello, my name is Joe. I earned an English degree at Saint Joseph's University, where I focused on literary theory and dived *deep* into the rabbit hole of existentialism, modernism and postmodernism. I worked for a few years at the Philadelphia Housing Authority and then attended Temple University Beasley School of Law, where I earned a law degree in 2013. I have been licensed to practice law in New Jersey and Pennsylvania since 2014.

Areas of law I'm interested in include:

- Startups
- Freelancers
- Artists
- Estate planning

Get in touch if you want to discuss your situation. If I'm not certain I can give you the representation you need I will find someone who can and get you in contact with them. Email me at <a href="mailto:law@joeross.me">hi@joeross.me</a> or call me at 215-253-7146.
