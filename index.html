<p><a href="http://nytimes.com/2014/07/29/us/spending-big-to-fight-big-donors.html">Larry Lessig fighting for campaign finance reform with Mayday PAC
</a></p>

<p>Lawrence Lessig&rsquo;s <a href="https://mayday.us">Mayday PAC</a> is using the very system it decries to attempt to bring that system down. In other words, Lessig et al are hijacking the virus (the influence of big donors on American politics via election contributions) to deliver the vaccine (funding for politicians committed to proposals which would limit big political contributions).</p>

<p>If you support the cause, be heartened: Lessig <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/27/226834651/record-label-picks-a-fight-over-copyright-with-the-wrong-guy">likes to fight</a>, and is good at it.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t support the cause, it&rsquo;s probably time to start taking Mayday seriously. Your candidate&rsquo;s job may depend on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1wQ7jYw">Facebook is not free</a></p>

<p>If you use Facebook, this article is a must-read. It’s now common knowledge Facebook is always watching and analyzing how you use the service. But the breadth and depth of the company’s participation in the data brokering economy is staggering. The worst part? You literally signed up for it.</p>

<p>Facebook obviously doesn’t charge its users money, but the mere act of creating a profile affirmatively grants the company total access and usage rights over everything you do on the site. It even shares its data about you with data brokerage firms whose business model is monetizing you.</p>

<p>This is all stuff I have personally known and accepted for a long time, but as the ability to easily aggregate dossiers on anyone and everyone increases, it’s more important than ever to educate yourself and those you care about. Facebook is not free, and in fact it’s worth asking whether the price most people pay by clicking a harmless-looking “I agree” button is really worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1roiuqV">Why we don&rsquo;t speak up at work</a></p>

<p>This piece by Claire Lew at Signal v. Noise doesn’t exactly fit into my general topics of law, technology and design, but it’s so important I that feel obligated to share it. I mention in my article about the role of metrics in editorial strategy that I’ve been present for some poor decisions and didn’t speak my mind.</p>

<p>Claire’s post explains exactly why I failed to speak up, and it’s an important read whether you’re a manager or not. Unlike more navel-gazing, hand-wavy articles in the management advice realm, she actually offers some practical advice.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Jai Krishna, reporting on the reaction of Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to the outcry over the company’s experiment on the emotions of nearly 700,000 unwitting users:</li>
</ol>


<blockquote>
  We take privacy and security at Facebook really seriously because that is something that allows people to share” opinions and emotions, Sandberg said.
</blockquote>


<p>The telling part about Sandberg’s reaction is that those who take privacy and security seriously don’t have to say very often, if at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://twit.tv/twil">Podcast of the Week: This Week in Law</a></p>

<p>When it comes to my own website, editorial calendars always give way to real life. I&rsquo;m back with the latest in a series that would be more accurately called the &ldquo;Podcast of the Month.&rdquo; I really need to step it up with these, as I still have about 70 of them to which I listen with some regularity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m featuring This Week In Law, a podcast covering technology, privacy, intellectual property and other areas of the law relevant to the internet and its users, for a couple of reasons. The first is that the most recent episode (embedded below), entitled <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law/265">Monkeys, Ducks and Unicorns</a>, discusses the Aereo case as well as a recent Fourth Amendment case about cell phones, both decided by the Supreme Court in June.</p>

<p>The second reason I&rsquo;m featuring This Week in Law is because I have probably listened to more hours of this podcast than any other. It got me through law school by education, entertaining and inspiring me, even while I was studying far less interesting areas of the law. The voices of Denise Howell and Evan Brown, in a way that only happens on the internet, more familiar to me than some of my longest friends&#8217; voices.</p>

<p>Subscribe to This Week In Law in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-law-mp3/id202795271">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://pcasts.in/twl">Pocket Casts</a> or <a href="http://feeds.twit.tv/twil.xml">RSS</a>.</p>

<p>HuffPo and BuzzFeed co-founder Jonah Peretti recently said in a long and fascinating <a href="https://medium.com/matter/buzzfeeds-jonah-peretti-goes-long-e98cf13160e7">interview</a> by Felix Salmon published at <em>Matter</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  I love metrics and I love thinking about optimization, but I think that the optimal state is being slightly suboptimal because as soon as you try to actually optimize, particularly for a single metric, you end up finding that the best way to optimize for that metric ends up perverting the metric and making the metric mean the opposite of what it used to mean.
</blockquote>


<p>This reminded me of an idea I&rsquo;ve been kicking around for a while about how best to approach digital editorial strategy: it requires an ability to wield metrics, vision and instinct in just the right proportions.</p>

<p>Parker Higgins of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, lamenting the recent removal of a public domain NASA clip he posted on the audio sharing site SoundCloud:</p>

<p>The real goofy bit is that before I started at EFF, I worked at SoundCloud. I actually uploaded this Apollo 13 clip, along with sounds from Apollo 11 and others, as part of a project to attract more historic and archival audio and really celebrate the public domain as a rich source of sounds.</p>

<p>Copyright law has been trending in favor of rights holders for a long time. That’s precisely why unlawful claims of copyright over public domain works are so despicable.</p>

<p>Aviva Rutkin, reporting in <em>New Scientist</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  A team of researchers, led by Adam Kramer at Facebook in Menlo Park, California, was curious to see if this phenomenon would occur online. To find out, they manipulated which posts showed up on the news feeds of more than 600,000 Facebook users. For one week, some users saw fewer posts with negative emotional words than usual, while others saw fewer posts with positive ones.
</blockquote>


<p>Forget about the <a href="http://ift.tt/1wXmZLE">filter bubble</a>, Facebook is (and has been <a href="http://ift.tt/12ESlqE">since at least 2009</a>) a Petri dish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1m3ic7U">Budgets and egos</a></p>

<p>Mark Headd, Philly’s first Chief Data Officer, who quit in spring of 2013, talking to Juliana Reyes of Technically Philly about why he resigned the post:</p>

<p>“A self-certifying website is a 20th century answer to the problem of tax deadbeats,” he wrote in an email. “An open data API is a 21st century answer to the problem. And that was my single biggest frustration during my time at the city — we were constantly using 20th century answers to problems that required a 21st century solution.”</p>

<p>I know from personal experience and talking with friends that this is a common complaint of tech-savvy government employees, especially leaders ostensibly authorized to do something about it but never truly empowered.</p>

<p>Budgets and egos slow technological (and many other forms of) progress to a glacial pace in many government settings.</p>

<p>I once spent valuable time collecting requirements for a piece of vital software, researching and recommending a reasonably priced and effective off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<p>Instead, someone decided to shoehorn the new use case into an aging enterprise software suite that had never seemed anything more than an ugly utilitarian GUI on top of a fancy backend of connected spreadsheets.</p>

<p>There was no line-item cost to the shoehorn solution, so it naturally looked like a winner when it came to budgeting. But the person-hours wasted reinventing the wheel easily outweighed the out-of-pocket cost of the solution I had proposed.</p>

<p>And aside from cost, persons in positions of power are often averse to being educated by twenty-somethings. That is especially true when it comes to technology, which most leaders know is important but few truly understand.</p>

<p>Budgets and egos.</p>

<p>Anyway, go read the rest of the article. It looks like Mr. Headd replies to comments, so it’s worth asking him any questions you might have.</p>
