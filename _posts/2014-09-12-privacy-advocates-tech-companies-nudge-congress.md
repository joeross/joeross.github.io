The distinction, included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_Communications_Act" target="_blank">Stored Communications Act </a>, was based on the need for users to access and download email from a service provider&#8217;s servers. The logic was that if someone hadn&#8217;t downloaded their email in six months or more, they had effectively abandoned it.</p>

<p>Of course, things are no longer that simple in the age of constant synchronization and push notifications on mobile devices.</p>
