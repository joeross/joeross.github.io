<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/" target="_blank">Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While we’re improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This surprised me at first. It didn&#8217;t surprise me that Cook would suggest users find a better experience elsewhere while Apple gets Maps to where they probably wanted it pre-launch anyway.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>It surprised me that:</p>

<ol><li>he listed so <em>many</em> alternatives, and</li>
<li>he included Google at all.</li>
</ol><p>Item 1 suggests that Cook is so confident in the updates Apple is working on for Maps for iOS that he doesn&#8217;t expect generously name-dropping the competition will hurt Maps usage in the long-term. If you&#8217;re working on a merely equivalent experience, you don&#8217;t send people away to so many other options, because people don&#8217;t come back to you for an equivalent experience. They come back to you for the <em>best</em> experience. So, if my logic holds, Maps will eventually become the <em>best</em> navigation experience available on any iOS device. And Tim Cook knows that everyone he sends to Waze or Nokia will eagerly give Maps a second chance when the time comes.</p>

<p>Item 2 is born of the narrative in the tech press about how Apple and Google are mortal enemies. Matt Cuts, chief spam ninja at Google, recently made it clear on <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google/165" target="_blank"><em>This Week in Google</em></a> that, at least from his perspective, Google loves Apple experiences and products. He is usually the only one in a meeting without an Apple laptop.</p>

<p>And then I remembered reading <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2012/09/133_121051.html" target="_blank">this article from the <em>Korea Times</em></a> yesterday by Cho Mu-hyun, quoting Google&#8217;s CEO Eric Schmidt as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple “is actually a very good partner. Our two companies are literally talking all the time about everything.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re best friends. But the popular image of Cook and Schmidt each throwing darts at a photo of the other whilst drinking liberally from a bottle of fermented <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=haterade" target="_blank">haterade</a> seems, well, made up. What about the &#8220;patent wars?&#8221; Cho&#8217;s article quotes Schmidt on that topic, as well, and those statements aren&#8217;t as warm-and-fuzzy as the quote above. But remember: these are huge companies. Apple engineers, working all the time, as Schmidt implied, with Google engineers, aren&#8217;t beholden to the late Steve Jobs&#8217; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-20/jobs-regretted-not-getting-cancer-surgery-sooner-biographer-isaacson-says.html" target="_blank">scorched earth patent policy</a>. They&#8217;re beholden to making money by building great user experiences (more on that below).</p>

<p>They are competitors not in the biblical sense, but in the business sense, and it makes business sense for competitors to pick their battles. The maps battle, it would seem, is a battle at least one of these companies picked.</p>

<p>Google is in the business of selling ads, and they sell more ads by collecting more data, and they collect more data by making more compelling user experiences.</p>

<p>Apple is in the business of selling proprietary hardware/software combinations, and they sell more proprietary hardware/software combinations by making more compelling user experiences.</p>

<p>The last clause in each of those sentences, &#8220;by making more compelling user experiences,&#8221; gives Apple and Google far more in common than the press narrative would have us believe.</p>
