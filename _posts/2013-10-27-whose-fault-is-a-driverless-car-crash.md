<a href='http://ideas.time.com/2013/03/14/whose-fault-is-a-driverless-car-crash/'>Whose Fault Is a Driverless-Car Crash?</a><div class="link_description"><p>Some possibilities not contemplated in this brief Time piece:</p>

<ul><li>software developer for driving computer</li>
<li>component designer/manufacturer of driving computer</li>
<li>technician who performed final calibration of driving computer</li>
<li>technician who installed driving computer</li>
<li>creator of simulation software used by technician to test computer</li>
</ul><p>In fact, car manufacturers and passengers are probably less likely to be at fault than any of the folks I list above.</p>

<p>After all, when a computer messes up in the present, it&#8217;s not really messing up: it&#8217;s telling you a human messed up in the past.</p></div>
