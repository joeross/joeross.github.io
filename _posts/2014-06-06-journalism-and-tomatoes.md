<a href='http://www.cjr.org/editorial/empty_calories.php'>Journalism and tomatoes</a><div class="link_description"><p>From a May 2013 editorial in the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps journalism can learn from the mistakes of the food industry, which bred a perfectly red, flawless-looking tomato, giving the edge to looks over taste, since thatâ€™s what consumers were buying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Redesigns focusing on <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/coming-in-the-side-door-the-value-of-homepages-is-shifting-from-traffic-driver-to-brand/" target="_blank">side door</a> web traffic will all be for naught if the product in that shiny new package languishes under clickbait headlines and  SEO-heavy ledes.</p></div>
