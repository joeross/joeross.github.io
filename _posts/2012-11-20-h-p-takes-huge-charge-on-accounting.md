Takes Huge Charge on 'Accounting Improprieties' at Autonomy</a><div class="link_description"><p>Michael J. de la Merced and Quentin Hardy, for the <em>Times&#8217;</em> DealBook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The charge essentially wiped out its profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The headline should say &#8220;outright misrepresentations,&#8221; not &#8220;accounting improprieties,&#8221; because the former is far more serious than the latter, and both are true.</p>

<p>HP hired Deloitte to review Autonomy&#8217;s books during the acquisition&#8217;s due diligence phase. Then they hired KPMG to audit Deloitte&#8217;s audit of Autonomy. Only after a former Autonomy employee tipped them off did they hire PricewaterhouseCoopers, who discovered Autonomy sold hardware at a loss, despite calling itself a successful software-only company.</p>

<p>Whoops. And it gets worse.</p>

<p>Go read it for yourself. I can&#8217;t take any more of this crap.</p></div>
