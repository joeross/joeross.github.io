<a href='http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/'>Say Hello to Samsung's Fanboy Factory - The Mobilers Program</a><div class="link_description"><p>Indian mobile tech blogger Clinton Jeff of <em><a href="http://unleashthephones.com/" target="_blank">Unleash the Phones</a></em>, talking to <em>The Next Web</em>'s Brad McCarty:</p>

<blockquote>We got a call from Samsung India saying ‘You can either be a part of this and wear the uniform, or you’ll have to get your own tickets back home and handle your hotel stay from the moment this call ends…</blockquote>

<p>Samsung released a statement calling the debacle a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; but only apologized to Mr. Jeff in the privately-emailed version of the statement. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/09/03/samsung-we-regret-misunderstanding-bloggers-forced-promote-products/" target="_blank">They said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I would like to reach out to you and deeply apologize to you for your experience in Berlin at IFA. We put you through undue hardship and we are trying to rectify the situation.</blockquote>

<p>Samsung&#8217;s behavior is inexcusable, and even worse for the lack of a public apology.</p></div>
