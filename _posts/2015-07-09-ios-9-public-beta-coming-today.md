[iOS 9 Public Beta coming today?](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/)

I rarely cross-post from [my geekery-focused Tumblr](http://joeross.tumblr.com), but I’m so excited about this I had to share it here, where I have literally thousands more followers.

I’ll be writing a proper post about the public beta after I’ve used it for a few days. There are some interesting legal consequences of agreeing to use beta software.
