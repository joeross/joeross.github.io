<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, the iPhone 5 was on sale for just nine days before the quarter ended. And it was supply-constrained the whole time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Siegler and Mr. Velazco pointed out the nine-day sales window the iPhone 5 had before these quarterly numbers were announced, but neither came right out and said what I find to be the most impressive expression of it:</p>

<p>Verizon activated over 72,000 iPhone 5s per day during the nine days ending the quarter.</p></div>
