<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Sussmann suggested that the Police Department could limit its subpoenas to phone calls beginning on the hour, not the day, of the theft, and ending as soon as the victim has transferred the number to a new phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Sussman is exactly right. I suspect the intent here on the part of NYPD is an admirable one: we have data available that can help us track thieves, so let&#8217;s use it.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not hard to limit the information requested to only the information that could possibly be of use in finding the suspect.</p></div>
