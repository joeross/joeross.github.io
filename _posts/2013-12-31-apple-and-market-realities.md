I would be unhappy as well if the attorney assigned by a federal judge to make sure I reformed my anti-competitive practices was sending me $1,100-per-hour bills. </p>

<p>The monitor, Michael Bromwich, submitted to the court on Dec. 30&#160;<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/194739635/Bromwich-Declaration" target="_blank">a detailed explanation</a> of Apple&#8217;s treatment of him and his team since their assignment in mid-September. He quotes Kyle Andeer, Apple&#8217;s director of competition law, as complaining he is &#8220;disappointed by [Bromwich&#8217;s] position on rates and other fees. They do not reflect market realities.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a former <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kyle-andeer/49/7b8/13" target="_blank">trial attorney at the Federal Trade Commission</a>, Andeer should know a thing or two about &#8220;market realities.&#8221; </p>

<p>But then again, it&#8217;s a distaste for those realities that got Apple a monitor in the first place.</p></div>
