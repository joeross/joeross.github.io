<a href='http://huffduffer.com/'>Huffduffer: custom podcast feeds</a><div class="link_description"><p>Huffduffer is a neat service for podcast geeks. Sign up and install the bookmarklet to add any compatible audio file to your feed. It&#8217;s perfect for people who want to piece together a feed of specific episodes without subscribing to every podcast they find.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://huffduffer.com/joeross" target="_blank">my own Huffduffer feed</a> contains a recent episode of <em>All Tech Considered</em> by NPR, several recent oral arguments from the Supreme Court (complete with convenient links to PDF transcripts) and more.</p>

<p>And if you&#8217;re a geek, the <a href="http://huffduffer.com/popular" target="_blank">Huffduffer Popular feed</a> is a great way to find out what other geeks are enjoying.</p></div>
