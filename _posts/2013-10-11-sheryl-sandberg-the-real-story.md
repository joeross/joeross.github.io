<a href='http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/10/leadership/sheryl-sandberg-mpw.pr.fortune/'>Sheryl Sandberg: The real story</a><div class="link_description"><p>CNN&#8217;s Miguel Helft, in a great profile of Sandberg at the Money blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How Sandberg, amid all her Facebook activities, managed to write Lean In, orchestrate flashy book tours on three continents, launch a foundation, and become a ubiquitous spokesperson for the ambitions of women, remains baffling to most people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her advocacy for women in business is great, but what I find most impressive about Sandberg is not that she is a woman and an executive, but an executive with such a full plate who seems to truly love what she does.</p></div>
