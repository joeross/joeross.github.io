<blockquote>
  <p>“This means the attacks average out at about 1,833 per minute or 30 every second.” Those figures are simply astonishing. Extrapolating the other way, it means the US Navy is attacked some 96.36 billion times every year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ever doubted the importance of cyber-preparedness, this should go a long way toward assuaging those doubts.</p></div>
