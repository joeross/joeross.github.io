<a href='http://www.abajournal.com/mobile/mag_article/scorned_as_copyright_troll_poet_fights_back_in_verse'>Poetic copyright troll illustrates need for reform</a><div class="link_description"><p>Linda Ellis, copyright troll:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If protecting my rights
  in your eyes makes me a “troll,”
  then I’ll wear the badge proudly
  and keep fulfilling my role.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Current law <em>does</em> allow hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for sharing drivel like the Ellis train wreck above. Real reform is needed, but it&#8217;s unlikely to get the requisite congressional attention any time soon.</p>

<p>Advocacy group Public Knowledge has a good start, called the <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/cra/" target="_blank">Copyright Reform Act</a>. It&#8217;s model legislation meant to provide a starting point for practical copyright reforms.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t read it all yet, but I&#8217;m confident it doesn&#8217;t allow hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for having your crappy poetry shared on the internet by strangers with bad taste in literature&#8230;</p></div>
