<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly the success of the Netflix model – releasing the entire season of House Of Cards at once – has proved one thing: the audience wants control. They want freedom. If they want to binge – as they&#8217;ve been doing on House Of Cards – then we should let them binge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s so simple, and while Netflix and a few others <em>have</em> learned the lesson the music industry so painfully failed to learn for so long, the television industry still fails to recognize and adapt to the dissipation of distinctions between which piece of glass is glowing with their product.</p></div>
