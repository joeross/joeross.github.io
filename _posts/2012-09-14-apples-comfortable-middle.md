<p>Hamish McKenzie, <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/09/13/yesterday-marked-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-apples-dominance-unless/" target="_blank">writing at <em>PandoDaily</em></a>&#160;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With two product launches in a row that show Apple is merely keeping pace with innovation rather than leading it, the worldâ€™s most valuable company will start to seem mortal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>For the record, I&#8217;m usually on board with Mr. McKenzie&#8217;s analyses, and I think he&#8217;s right that the iPhone 5 doesn&#8217;t restore the staggering lead Apple once had in smartphone innovation. I just don&#8217;t agree that there is <em>any</em> probable circumstance in which the iPhone 5 marks the beginning of the end of Apple&#8217;s dominance. I <em>want</em> him to be right, but I believe it will take <em>action</em> on the part of Apple&#8217;s competitors, rather than mere <em>inaction</em> from Cupertino, to catalyze that descent from the pinnacle.</p>

<p>I want to see something truly threaten Apple&#8217;s dominance: it would be good for consumers and even good for Apple, potentially motivating just the sort of next-generation innovation everyone wishes we saw with the iPhone 5. But Android is peddled in an ever-changing array of hardware of wildly varying quality, its interface often marred by manufacturer &#8220;improvements&#8221; and carrier-mandated bloatware, with no cohesive or remotely predictable software upgrade schedule.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s customizable, &#8220;open&#8221; (depending on how you define the term), and a provider of competitive pressure. In fact, Android, the <em>OS</em>, in its pristine Jelly Bean state on glorious hardware, is functional and gorgeous. But Android, the <em>experience</em> and, for lack of a better word, the <em>brand</em>, is truly a mess.</p>

<p>Then, there is the iPhone.</p>

<p>Apple tried for years to make things people loved. They succeeded. Now they are in the business of making <em>improvements</em> on the things they make that people love. And they&#8217;re succeeding there, too.</p>

<p>Whether or not they revolutionize TV next, and whether or not they drastically refresh iOS in the next couple of years, I think they&#8217;re still comfortably in the middle of their dominance, and at the top of their game.</p>
