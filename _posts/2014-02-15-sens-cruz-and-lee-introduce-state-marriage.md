<a href='http://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=926'>Sens. Cruz and Lee Introduce State Marriage Defense Act</a><div class="link_description"><p>At this point the anti-Constitutionalists are trolling themselves. A choice bit from this piece of garbage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bill will ensure the federal government gives the same deference to the 33 states that define marriage as the union between one man and one woman as it does to the 17 states that have chosen to recognize same-sex unions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how a state wants to define marriage, whether it&#8217;s full of crazy conservatives or mushy liberals. It only matters what the Constitution requires, and that is equal protection under the laws.</p>

<p>All consenting adults with the capacity to validly enter a contract are allowed to marry. Legislating around that fundamental right violates the Constitution.</p>
