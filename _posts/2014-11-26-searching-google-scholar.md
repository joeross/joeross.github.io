<a href='http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/11/searching-google-scholar/'>Searching Google Scholar</a><div class="link_description"><p>I&#8217;m trying to post fewer links, which means I&#8217;ve been posting less frequently in general. I&#8217;m working on some articles, but until they&#8217;re ready to publish I&#8217;ll still share the occasional link.</p>

<p>This one is a great article from the American Bar Association&#8217;s <em>Law Technology Today</em> blog about getting the most out of <a href="http://google.com/scholar" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>. Legal research platforms are usually very expensive, so Google&#8217;s free alternative is a great way to peruse this stuff.</p>

<p>As a law clerk, I have access to LexisNexis for legal research. But I find Google Scholar is a much easier and faster way to <em>begin</em> a research project. Lexis uses some proprietary search syntax, which I learned in law school but despise having to use.</p>

<p>If you have access to <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-advance.page" target="_blank">Lexis Advance</a> or <a href="http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/westlaw-legal-research" target="_blank">Westlaw Next</a>, those products bring simpler search syntax to the paid-research world. But if not, use Google Scholar to get a good sense of the landscape and then head to a paid service to make sure the law is still good, and to follow research leads that may not present themselves in Google Scholar.</p></div>
