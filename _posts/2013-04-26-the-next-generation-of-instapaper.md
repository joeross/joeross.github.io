<a href='http://www.marco.org/2013/04/25/instapaper-next-generation'>The next generation of Instapaper</a><div class="link_description"><p>Marco Arment has turned control of his read-it-later service, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>, over to incubator-turned-company-in-its-own-right <a href="http://betaworks.com/" target="_blank">Betaworks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m happy to announce that I’ve sold a majority stake in Instapaper to Betaworks. We’ve structured the deal with Instapaper’s health and longevity as the top priority, with incentives to keep it going well into the future. I will continue advising the project indefinitely, while Betaworks will take over its operations, expand its staff, and develop it further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#8217;s <em>really</em> intriguing about this is that the Betaworks website includes the following teaser:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Want early access to the new Instapaper and other products we build and invest in? Join <a href="http://betaworks.com/openbeta.php" target="_blank">Openbeta</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder whether the &#8220;new Instapaper&#8221; is already in the works, or this is just a clever marketing ploy to get Instapaper fans signed up for Betaworks&#8217; Openbeta mailing list.</p>

<p>All in all, Instapaper is an amazing product, and if Betaworks&#8217; reanimation of <a href="http://digg.com" target="_blank">Digg</a> is any indication, they&#8217;re a good custodian.</p></div>
