<a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/21/amazon-forces-publishers-pay-vat-ebook'>Amazon's "phantom" 20% VAT for UK ebook sales</a><div class="link_description"><p>Ian Griffiths and Dan Milmo of <em>The Guardian</em>, quoting &#8221; a contract seen by the Guardian,&#8221; presumably between Amazon and one of its UK publishing &#8220;partners&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the base price exceeds the base price … provided to a similar service then … the base price hereunder will be deemed to be equal to such lower price, effective as of the date such lower price comes into effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a good deal, especially coupled with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/amazon-to-customers-three-publishers-settled-antitrust-suit-expect-refund/" target="_blank">the recent ebooks settlement</a>.</p>

<p>The US antitrust regime is focused on protecting consumer interests. That means that as long as Amazon&#8217;s book selection continues to rise and their prices continue to fall, they&#8217;re unlikely to see any problems on the competition law front.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s probably not good for consumers in the long-run, especially given Amazon&#8217;s DRM and <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/amazon-kindle-drm/" target="_blank">control over your devices and library</a>. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here and predict that Amazon will face some antitrust scrutiny of its own in the next year.</p></div>
