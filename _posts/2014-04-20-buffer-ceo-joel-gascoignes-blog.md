<a href='http://joel.is/'>Buffer CEO Joel Gascoigne's blog</a><div class="link_description"><p>Joel Gascoigne is a co-founder and the CEO of <a href="http://bufferapp.com" target="_blank">Buffer</a>, the most powerful tool for sharing and scheduling stuff across multiple social networks. It’s a great service and one I use almost daily. But more importantly, Joel’s thoughtful blog is a great way to read about how he and his co-founder, Leo Widrich, run a successful startup.</p></div>
