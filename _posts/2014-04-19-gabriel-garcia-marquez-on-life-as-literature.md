<a href='http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3196/the-art'>Gabriel García Márquez on life as literature</a><div class="link_description"><p>The recently deceased García Márquez, in an interview published in the winter 1981 issue of <em>The Paris Review</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My mother asked me to accompany her to Aracataca, where I was born, and to sell the house where I spent my first years. When I got there it was at first quite shocking because I was now twenty-two and hadn’t been there since the age of eight. Nothing had really changed, but I felt that I wasn’t really looking at the village, but I was experiencing it as if I were reading it. It was as if everything I saw had already been written, and all I had to do was to sit down and copy what was already there and what I was just reading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never read his work (a sin of literary omission I will soon remedy), but in this story García Márquez perfectly described a sensation I have at least once a week. It’s why I started writing fiction again recently after a long drought.</p>

<p>Go read the rest of the interview, it’s great.</p></div>
