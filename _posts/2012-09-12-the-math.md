<a href='http://massivegreatness.com/fuck-math'>"The Math"</a><div class="link_description"><p>Once again, MG Siegler nails it on HBO&#8217;s missed opportunity for direct-subscription innovation.</p>

<p>Most companies are so desperate to maintain anything close to an upward slant in revenue year-over-year that they <em>never even know</em> opportunities like this one exist.</p>

<p>The worst part of this situation, to me, is the fact that HBO is being <em>repeatedly</em> told about this opportunity and actively ignoring it merely because it doesn&#8217;t make short-term business sense.</p></div>
