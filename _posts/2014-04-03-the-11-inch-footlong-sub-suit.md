<a href='http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/04/02/subway-reaches-tentative-deal-with-plaintiffs-over-footlong-claims/'>The 11-inch footlong sub suit</a><div class="link_description"><p>Sometimes, the law is a noble pursuit with which bold attorneys can defend and uplift the rights and voices of laypersons subjected to injustice of the grossest extreme.</p>

<p>And sometimes, Subway’s “footlong” sandwich measures up to only 11 inches long, and someone just has to sue.</p>

<p>What amazes me about this case isn’t that it happened. After all, this is America. Nor is it that the judge didn’t reach the question whether this case is proper for class action certification.</p>

<p>No, what amazes me about this case is that the parties had exchanged “about a thousand pages” in discovery through February, one of the plaintiff’s lawyers told Jacob Gershman at The Wall Street Journal Law Blog.</p></div>
