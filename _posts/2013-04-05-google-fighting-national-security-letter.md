<a href='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-04/google-fights-u-s-national-security-probe-data-demand.html'>Google fighting National Security Letter</a><div class="link_description"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter" target="_blank">The letters</a>, issued by federal authorities investigating national security concerns, prohibit recipients from disclosing that they have received them, let alone what they&#8217;re asking for. The Judge in Google&#8217;s case<sup id="fnref:p47208273173-1"><a href="p47208273173-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup> struck down the law&#8217;s gag order provision as violative of the First Amendment, but has stayed the effect of that decision while the government pursues an appeal.</p>

<p>I should note that I essentially paraphrased the Wikipedia article for that second sentence, as my knowledge of NSLs is limited. I look forward to reading more on them, and I&#8217;m glad to see a company with the clout and caliber of attorneys that Google has questioning the legality of the NSL framework.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem odd that a company that siphons so much data about its users would be so protective of it when the government is asking for it.</p>

<p>But it makes sense for Google to defend user information: it needs that information to make its advertising products more relevant, Many accept the trade of having their documents and emails scanned and anonymized by Google in exchange for exceptional and <em>free</em> services. If Google fails to protect that information from surveillance via legal tools of questionable constitutionality, the balance of that trade may tip too far for many users.</p>

<p>Thus, this is one of those rare cases where corporate goals and user concerns are aligned.</p>
