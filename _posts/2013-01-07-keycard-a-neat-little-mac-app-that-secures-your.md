<blockquote>
  <p>In our tests, I had mixed results. Initially, my iPhone continued to remain in range, meaning that if I was to walk around the office or different rooms in the house, my Mac remained awake and usable. However, if I went outside a range of around 10-15 meters, Keycard did its thing without an issue.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure $6.99 is a viable price for 1.0 app whose developers are still perfecting activation range and that is suffering from &#8220;random screen locks when the device is still in range,&#8221; but it&#8217;s a neat concept. I&#8217;d find it especially useful in an Apple-focused office environment or a co-working space. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/keycard/id578513438" target="_blank">direct link to the iTunes store</a> if you want to check it out.</p></div>
