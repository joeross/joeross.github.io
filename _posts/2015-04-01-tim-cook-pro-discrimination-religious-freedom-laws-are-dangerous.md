[Tim Cook: Pro-discrimination ‘religious freedom’ laws are dangerous](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/pro-discrimination-religious-freedom-laws-are-dangerous-to-america/2015/03/29/bdb4ce9e-d66d-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html)

Tim Cook, in an op-ed at the _Washington Post_:

> Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination. 

I admire the visible positions Cook is [taking](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-speaks-up) on more and more [issues](http://fortune.com/2015/03/26/tim-cook/) these days.
