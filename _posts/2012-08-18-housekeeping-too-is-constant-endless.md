<p>I&#8217;m changing a few things as I settle into my new theme and workflow here at <em>Constant &amp; Endless</em>.</p>

<p>In no particular order, those things are:</p>

<ul><li>I have changed the title of the RSS feed for this site from &#8220;By Joe Ross&#8221; to &#8220;Constant &amp; Endless.&#8221;</li>
<li>I&#8217;m appending &#8220;â†—&#8221; to all link posts to make clear what kind of post you&#8217;re looking at. If that&#8217;s confusing, <a href="http://joeross.me/contact/" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</li>
<li>Link posts will appear in this color and article titles will appear in <strong>bold black</strong>.</li>
</ul>
