<p>Farhad Manjoo, <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/05/12/what-eduardo-saverin-owes-america-hint-nearly-everything/" target="_blank">writing at <em>PandoDaily</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At just about every step between his landing in Miami and his becoming a co-founder of Facebook, you find American institutions and inventions playing a significant part in his success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Manjoo doesn&#8217;t agree with Saverin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-12/facebook-co-founder-may-gain-choosing-singapore-over-u-s-.html" target="_blank">decision to renounce US citizenship</a> just in time to make sure his expected Facebook-IPO windfall escapes capital gains tax, netting him an extra ~$600 million. Manjoo, like Saverin, found a life in the United States he could never have had in his home country.</p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/05/12/saverins-citizenship-renunciation-before-facebook-ipo-will-increase-not-reduce-his-tax-bill/" target="_blank">it may not be such a clear-cut windfall</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/just-like-eduardo-nearly-1800-people-renounced-us-citizenship-this-year-over-taxes/2012/05/12/gIQAX1PQKU_story.html" target="_blank">Saverin is certainly not alone</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless, I understand Manjoo&#8217;s position, but unfortunately it&#8217;s not realistic. Like I said in <a href="http://fyre.it/119e" target="_blank">a comment on the article</a>, American individuals and businesses avoid as much taxation as lawfully possible every year. Unless Saverin is breaking the law, the rest is probably clickbait.</p>
