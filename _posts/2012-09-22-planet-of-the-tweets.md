<a href='http://blog.twitter.com/2012/09/best-practices-for-journalists.html'>Planet of the Tweets</a><div class="link_description"><p>Twitter&#8217;s extensive research identified four ways news outlets can better engage their audiences.</p>

<p>Funny how all four look like things Twitter&#8217;s early and most &#8220;engaged&#8221; users have been doing since the service&#8217;s inception.</p>

<p>The same users Twitter is frequently screwing with reckless abandon these days.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you see? <em>We</em> gave them the tools to leverage increased brand engagement (buzzword overload!).</p>

<p>Kind of like how the planet of the apes wasn&#8217;t another planet at all&#8230;</p></div>
