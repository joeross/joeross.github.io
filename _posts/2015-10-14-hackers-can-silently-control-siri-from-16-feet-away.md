[Hackers Can Silently Control Siri From 16 Feet Away](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/this-radio-trick-silently-hacks-siri-from-16-feet-away/)

Well this is concerning:

> A pair of researchers at ANSSI, a French government agency devoted to information security, have shown that they can use radio waves to silently trigger voice commands on any Android phone or iPhone that has Google Now or Siri enabled, if it also has a pair of headphones with a microphone plugged into its jack. Their clever hack uses those headphones’ cord as an antenna, exploiting its wire to convert surreptitious electromagnetic waves into electrical signals that appear to the phone’s operating system to be audio coming from the user’s microphone. Without speaking a word, a hacker could use that radio attack to tell Siri or Google Now to make calls and send texts, dial the hacker’s number to turn the phone into an eavesdropping device, send the phone’s browser to a malware site, or send spam and phishing messages via email, Facebook, or Twitter.

You can disable Siri whenever your iOS device is locked by going to **Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Allow Access When Locked** and toggling the Siri switch to the "off" (as in not green) position. This doesn't guarantee a hack like the one deascribed above won't work on your device, but it does guarantee you'll see Siri doing something weird and can thus be alerted to the hackery.
