<p>Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson granted an emergency request by six gay couples, ordering state officials to begin officiating same-sex marriages on Oct. 21.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is really great news.</p>

<p>But&#8230;</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>As is so often the case in litigation, this is by no means the end of the issue in New Jersey. From the Superior Court, the Christie administration&#8217;s lawyers can appeal up to the state Supreme Court if they need to.</p>

<p><span>One of their arguments, and the one that is sure to be front-and-center in any </span>appellate<span> brief they file, is that the Superior Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the marriage benefits in question were federal, not state, benefits.</span></p>

<p><span>It&#8217;s worth noting those who get married under today&#8217;s decision may eventually find themselves in a legal gray area if a higher court reverses the outcome.</span></p>

<p>The decision itself is available in PDF form <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/samesex/Decision_Summary_Judgment.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>
