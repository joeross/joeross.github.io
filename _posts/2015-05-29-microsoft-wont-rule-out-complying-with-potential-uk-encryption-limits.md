[Microsoft's won't rule out complying with potential UK encryption limits](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/05/27/brad-smith-suggests-microsoft-might-obey-law-that-limits-encryption/)

Danny Yadron at *The Wall Street Journal* quoted Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith:

> “It’s a big market, and it’s a country we believe has a fundamental rule of law in place,” Smith said at an event in Palo Alto, Calif., hosted by the Chertoff Group. “We still don’t like it, but you could imagine one argument that says, ‘OK, we’re going to do it.’ ”

That's an interesting stance, especially from the parent company of Skype, who recently [got in trouble with a Belgian court](http://www.wsj.com/articles/belgian-court-summons-skype-over-refusal-to-hand-over-suspects-data-1432666262) for refusing to allow a wiretap.
