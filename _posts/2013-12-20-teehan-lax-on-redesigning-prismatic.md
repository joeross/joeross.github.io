<a href='http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/prismatic-for-ios-why-designing-content-systems-is-hard/'>Teehan+Lax on redesigning Prismatic</a><div class="link_description"><p>It’s a great post by great designers about the work and value that goes into and comes out of great design. It also happens to explain very clearly <a href="/about" target="_blank">the concept</a> behind my own website here at Constant &amp; Endless.</p>

<p>Geoff Teehan of Teehan+Lax writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the end, a successful project is never done. It is never perfect. If you aren’t learning from it, then you’ve given up. It’s a constant process of assessing the landscape, making hard choices and accepting trade-offs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like Saleem Sinai says in Salman Rushdie’s novel Midnight’s Children, &#8220;the process of revision should be constant and endless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prismatic is a content discovery engine powered by your own wide array of interests, aiming to avoid being limited by your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble" target="_blank">filter bubble</a> of common sharing tendencies. Check it out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/prismatic-always-interesting/id551206444?mt=8" target="_blank">on iOS</a> or <a href="http://www.getprismatic.com/" target="_blank">the web</a>.</p></div>
