<p>Well, I only read stuff <em>published online</em>, that I don&#8217;t want to or can&#8217;t read the moment I come across it, that plays nicely with Instapaper. But that sentence doesn&#8217;t make a very good headline.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<h2>The Tool and its Critics</h2>

<p><a href="http://instapaper.com" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> is one of several services that will save articles you find online for you to read later, even if you&#8217;re not connected to the internet when you finally have a moment to read. Instapaper is by <a href="http://marco.org" target="_blank">Marco Arment</a>, a developer who wanted a way to save articles to read later. This motivation by personal use case, coupled with a reasonable revenue model, assure me that Instapaper isn&#8217;t going to &#8220;pivot&#8221; or go away or otherwise change in pursuit of survival.</p>

<p>Some publishers, however, object to services like Instapaper because its success as a business, or even as a free app, as in the case of Instapaper&#8217;s many competitors, is predicated on enabling the large-scale time shifting of reading material produced by other businesses, without their permission. This is done by &#8220;scraping,&#8221; which just means copying the article text into an ad-free format on the reading service&#8217;s own servers.</p>

<h2>User Experience is Everything</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s an experience worth paying for from a reader&#8217;s perspective though, and one of the major reasons behind that is that many digital content publishers don&#8217;t design their sites to optimize the reading experience.</p>

<p>Even my favorite sites fail the content/non-content page space ratio test, perhaps best described by Ben Brooks in his post <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/11/readable/" target="_blank">The Design of a Site Meant to be Read</a>. My own site here at <em>Constant &amp; Endless</em> is a conscious overreaction to the clutter-happy design aesthetic that permeates the modern web. I started with a <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/9601" target="_blank">minimal Tumblr template</a>, and then modified it extensively to maximize readability.</p>

<p>Some sites have no clutter at all, but their use of really <em>tiny</em> font size makes them, at least for me, difficult to read. For example, one of my favorite daily reads is John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a>, but I need to use an RSS reader to peruse his posts because the font on the website itself is a couple of sizes too small for me to sit back and enjoy.</p>

<h2>The Purpose and the Problem</h2>

<p>The primary reason that I pay for Instapaper is that it gives me things I want to read <em>at a time and in a manner in which I actually want to read them</em>. I would happily pay for a &#8220;reader&#8217;s edition&#8221; of any number of popular news sites and blogs if it meant a lack of ads and a minimal, readable design aesthetic. I will never find a pay-wall that grants nothing but access to a still-shitty reading experience a compelling proposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Arment&#8217;s text parser is so effective that I am always a little surprised when I come across an article it can&#8217;t digest. So, when I encountered a maimed version of a <em>Scientific American</em> article in my Instapaper queue, I wasn&#8217;t mad at Marco Arment for failing to compensate for the innumerable ways in which publishers can format content for the web. I was mad at <em>Scientific American</em> because they have not yet complied with my preferred mode of consumption.</p>

<h2>My Shameless Reading-Related Irrationality</h2>

<p>In fact, <em>there is now a voice in my mind that declares that a web publication that does not care how its content looks in Instapaper isn&#8217;t nearly as worth my time as it was in a pre-Instapaper world.</em></p>

<p>This includes <em>The New York Times</em>, whose articles frequently fail to play nicely with Instapaper. For example, on one of the days I spent revising this article, both the most-emailed and the most-viewed articles on NYTimes.com loaded only one paragraph in Instapaper, and the most-blogged article didn&#8217;t parse at all&#8212;it forwarded me back out to the NYTimes.com website to fetch the original web page. This happens all the time.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>It means I probably won&#8217;t read much web content by <em>The New York Times</em>. And I think that&#8217;s a totally crazy and even intellectually indefensible position for me to take.  It&#8217;s not rational and I&#8217;m almost certain that I miss out on some amazing reading material because of it, but it&#8217;s there, and I heed it despite my better judgement.</p>

<h2>A Reader&#8217;s Future</h2>

<p>I suspect that the future will only produce more people like me. There is a focus on apps and services that can sort through all of our preferred sources and inboxes and show us what we most want or need to see. Many of those apps and services provide a better reading experience than the sources through which they&#8217;re sorting. But it is very difficult to sort to any (let alone <em>every</em>) user&#8217;s consistent satisfaction. So, for those apps and services, reading will always be a secondary functionality. Instapaper and its competitors (to varying degrees), on the other hand, usually leave it to us to find what we like, and they instead focus on the best possible reading experience.</p>

<p>I think reading experience will matter more with every passing financial quarter, as tablet (let&#8217;s be honest, really just iPad) sales continue and people consume more and more web content from a device that is made for comfortable reading. Maybe it won&#8217;t be Instapaper, and maybe it won&#8217;t be <em>Scientific American</em>, but people will increasingly demand that publishers comply with their preferred modes of consumption. And those who get it right, like Mr. Arment, will achieve what a multitude of designers, editors, and publishers have not been able to: a reading experience worth paying for.</p>
