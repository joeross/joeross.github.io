<a href='http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/286599-house-bill-would-require-police-to-obtain-a-warrant-to-search-emails'>ECPA amendment would require warrant even for email older than 6 months</a><div class="link_description"><p>Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Ted Poe (R-Texas), and Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) are pushing an amendment to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that would require a warrant for authorities to obtain any email, instead of allowing free access to messages older than six months.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://joeross.me/post/41795517982/at-google-constitution-trumps-statute" target="_blank">wrote in January</a> about Google&#8217;s decision to require a warrant even where the law does not, so the ECPA&#8217;s shortcomings in the digital age (the law is more than twenty years old) are sometimes mitigated by responsible corporate policies.</p>

<p>But a legitimate amendment like Lofgren&#8217;s would apply Google&#8217;s common sense approach to 4th Amendment rights to all such service providers. There&#8217;s simply no excuse not to get this done.</p></div>
