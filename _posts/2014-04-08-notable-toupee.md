<a href='http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/paramount-demands-wolf-wall-street-694267'>“Notable toupee”</a><div class="link_description"><p>I wanted to share this because it’s a funny phrase, and I think it’s important to keep an eye out for humor, intentional or otherwise, in civil litigation filings.</p>
