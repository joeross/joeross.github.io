<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/twitter-changes-are-now-all-about-advertisers-not-the-users/'>Twitter continues to value advertiser utility above user experience</a><div class="link_description"><p>Romain Dillet at <em>TechCrunch</em> explains it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now when you land on a company profile page, you will see a big brand name with a small @username below, a gigantic header photo, a small logo next to every tweet, photos of new products in the sidebar without having to scroll, a pinned tweet at the top of the timeline for a current promotion, and finally the traditional flow of tweets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Twitter is not hiding the ball on this one: their <a href="http://advertising.twitter.com/2012/09/new-twitter-profile-pages-richer-way-to.html" target="_blank">advertising blog post</a> makes it hard to see the new profiles as motivated by anything <em>but</em> improving advertiser utility.</p>

<p>Twitter&#8217;s downward spiral into user-neutral (at best) and user-hostile (at worst) changes suggests their ignorance of the operating principle I <a href="http://joeross.me/post/31407644616/gruber-on-amazons-play" target="_blank">mentioned last week</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a shame, because the company-first-via-users-first approach is serving Amazon and Apple, and their partners and users, very well.</p></div>
