<a href='http://lifehacker.com/5989980/ive-been-using-evernote-all-wrong-heres-why-its-actually-amazing?popular=true'>Whitson Gordon finally figured out Evernote</a><div class="link_description"><p>I&#8217;m not being snarky: he writes at <em>Lifehacker</em> about how he never &#8220;got&#8221; Evernote, until recently. It&#8217;s a great article and I can say I&#8217;ve made at least some use of every technique Gordon discusses. The most important? Use Evernote all the time, for everything, and it will become a powerful part of your workflow.</p></div>
