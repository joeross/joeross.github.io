<a href='http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/10/10/judge-googles-tracking-not-harmful/'>One Google, two different privacy rulings</a><div class="link_description"><p>Stanford researcher Jonathan Mayer, in an email to the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Elizabeth Dwoskin and Rolfe Winkler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Courts are doing pretzel twists to slot modern electronic privacy issues into antiquated statutory schemes. Congress badly needs to update the nation&#8217;s privacy laws; we can&#8217;t leave the courts with so little guidance and expect consistent results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inconsistent application of the law across states suggests the issue may be ripe for appeal on both fronts, and may be on a long journey to the Supreme Court.

The Delaware court saw no harm in Google&#8217;s circumvention of browser-based privacy settings and thus no cause of action.</p>

<p>What interests me is that the information you can collect via someone&#8217;s browsing behavior with a cookie is probably similar to the information you can collect by scanning their email, the action at issue in the North Carolina case, in which the judge denied Google&#8217;s motion to to dismiss the suit.</p>

<p>Thus, it&#8217;s the difference in the <em>method</em> of collection, even where the <em>subject</em> of collection is the same, that may be triggering the proliferation of multiple interpretations of privacy law.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#8217;s worth noting that the wiretap law refers specifically to communication interception, which applies directly to email. While browsing history can tell a great deal about someone, it&#8217;s not, strictly speaking, a mode of communication, so plaintiffs probably need to rely more on the common law.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time to sink my teeth into the issue, but I&#8217;ll have to settle for sharing a few useful links on privacy law for those interested in learning more:</p>
