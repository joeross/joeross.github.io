[Video gamer hunts down, stabs man who killed his online 'Counter-Strike' character](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/video-gamer-hunts-stabs-man-killed-online-counter-strike-character-article-1.447608)

Michael Sheridan reports at NYDailyNews.com: 

> Julien Barreaux reportedly spent six months looking for the person who killed his online character in a virtual knife fight, and eventually found the foe living only a few miles away in Cambrai, a town about 2 hours north of Paris.

The lunatic only got two years' imprisonment for what pretty plainly looks to me like premeditated attempted murder. I don't know anything about French law, but that seems like an embarrassing outcome for any prosecutor.
