<a href='http://thedesk.matthewkeys.net/2013/11/01/doj-could-prosecute-al-jazeera-americas-calderon-source/'>FBI asks DOJ to investigate source of Calderon leak to Al Jazeera</a><div class="link_description"><p>It could be that I&#8217;m new to the journalism industry and only recently interested in its developments. But <span>it seems to me as if journalism and law are converging like never before, and on an international stage.</span></p>

<p>While Al Jazeera America is unlikely to face direct legal action, the American arm of the Qatari news network only launched in August 2013. It&#8217;s new, and if its current sources face investigation and potential federal charges, prospective sources may decide not to become sources at all. </p></div>
