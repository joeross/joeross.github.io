<a href='http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/02/23/falcon-pro-hits-100k-token-limit-another-twitter-client-bites-the-dust/'>Twitter kills my favorite Twitter app for Android</a><div class="link_description"><p>In August, Twitter <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api" target="_blank">turned its back</a> on the sort of independent developers who built their community for them. Now, my favorite Twitter app for Android, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon.pro" target="_blank">Falcon Pro</a>, has hit Twitter&#8217;s artificial user limit.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>They have other apps, (like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon" target="_blank">an incredible widget that is also a fully-functional Twitter client</a>), but they can&#8217;t accept any more Falcon Pro users.</p>

<p>Falcon Pro&#8217;s left- and right-drawer layout, with an elegant, clutter-free but feature-packed design, won me over instantly. It came out just as I had given up on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotsandlines.carbon" target="_blank">Carbon for Twitter</a>, a beautiful app nearly dismissed as vaporware as it  faced numerous release setbacks.</p>

<p>Carbon finally came out, and it is very pretty, but Falcon Pro fits my personal Twitter use case best, so Carbon is a close second. You know what isn&#8217;t even in the top five? Twitter&#8217;s official Android client.</p>

<p>Over 3,000 people have signed a petition to raise Falcon Pro&#8217;s limit as of Saturday night, but that&#8217;s at Twitter&#8217;s absolute discretion, and it would set a bad precedent, so I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>

<p>But if you tried out Falcon Pro and didn&#8217;t like it, you can revoke the app&#8217;s access to your Twitter account, thereby freeing up a token for a new user. Redditor <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/classic__schmosby" target="_blank">classic_schmosby</a> explains in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/192ppq/falcon_pro_has_reached_its_token_limit/c8kahkz" target="_blank">this comment</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter: You can&#8217;t build and maintain a thriving ecosystem with token limits and patronizing blog posts about &#8220;building user value.&#8221; You will never offer a sufficient variety of apps to please all use cases. Your developer community fosters a massive user base that may not otherwise come to or stay with Twitter, pumping data into your system for you to monetize. Developers get and keep users for you by offering designs, features, and improvements that you cannot provide. Don&#8217;t stifle that, celebrate it.</p></div>
