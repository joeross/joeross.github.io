<a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/angry-judge-blasts-porn-trolls-someone-has-an-awful-lot-to-hide/'>Porn troll Prenda Law angers judge with shady behavior</a><div class="link_description"><p>Earlier this week I <a href="http://joeross.me/post/45218304200/eff-will-represent-targets-of-copyright-troll-prenda" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that the EFF was going to represent a couple of anti-trolling websites in a case brought by porno copyright troll Prenda Law.</p>

<p>The <em>Ars Technica</em> article by Megan Geuss is well-written and really conveys the absurdity of the situation in which Prenda has put itself. I urge you to click the link in this post&#8217;s title to go give her piece a full read.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#8217;re interested in keeping up with the latest in potential troll-stomping, consider keeping an eye on the <em>Ars</em> series <a href="http://arstechnica.com/series/whos-behind-prenda-law/" target="_blank">"Who&#8217;s behind Prenda Law?"</a>. They always do great work at <em>Ars</em> and this series is no exception.</p></div>
