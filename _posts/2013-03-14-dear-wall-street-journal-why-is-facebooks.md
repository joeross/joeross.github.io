<a href='http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323393304578360651345373308.html'>Dear Wall Street Journal: Why is Facebook's hashtag implementation news?</a><div class="link_description"><p>I love that this is &#8220;news&#8221; at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Perhaps the only news-worthy aspect of this story is that it&#8217;s one of those rare instances where Facebook is the one keeping up with the Joneses, instead of the other way around.</p>

<p>When will this vaunted hashtag implementation be completed? No one knows, despite <em>WSJ</em>'s having talked to some of those ubiquitous and ever-informative &#8220;people familiar with the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>What I think is <em>really</em> wonderful about this non-story is that it took not one but <em>two</em> people at <em>WSJ</em> to produce it, Evelyn M. Rusli and Shira Ovide. I don&#8217;t pretend to know the usual caliber of those journalists&#8217; work, but I hope, for their sake, that the topic of this blurb is uncharacteristically dull.</p></div>
