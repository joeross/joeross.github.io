<a href='http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/266649-conservatives-lambast-romney-vow-to-take-over-gop'>Conservatives lambast Romney, vow to take over Republican Party</a><div class="link_description"><p><em>The Hill&#8217;s</em> Erik Wasson, quoting Jenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She described Romney as a “weak, moderate candidate hand-picked by the country club elite Republican establishment [&#8230;] They didn’t see a clear distinction so they went with what they know,” she said of voters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Conservatives" is not an accurate descriptor of Tea Party sympathizers. "Extremists" and "fundamentalists" are better descriptors.</p>

<p>Actually, I think Romney&#8217;s farthest-right positions are the very ones that lost him this election. I keep hearing and reading about a growing movement among moderate Republicans (the original and, many would argue, &#8220;real&#8221; Conservatives) to take back their party.</p>

<p>If that narrative is accurate, and if that movement succeeds, the Republican party has a chance to put someone in the Oval Office in 2016. Those who would prefer a president with an (R) next to their name would do well to show the extremists and fundamentalists in their ranks the door.</p></div>
