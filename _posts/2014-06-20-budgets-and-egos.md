<a href='http://technical.ly/philly/2014/06/19/why-philadelphia-chief-data-officer-quit'>Budgets and egos</a><div class="link_description"><p>Mark Headd, Philly&#8217;s first Chief Data Officer, who quit in spring of 2013, talking to Juliana Reyes of Technically Philly about why he resigned the post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A self-certifying website is a 20th century answer to the problem of tax deadbeats,” he wrote in an email. “An open data API is a 21st century answer to the problem. And that was my single biggest frustration during my time at the city — we were constantly using 20th century answers to problems that required a 21st century solution.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know from personal experience and talking with friends that this is a common complaint of tech-savvy government employees, especially leaders ostensibly authorized to do something about it but never truly empowered.</p>

<p>Budgets and egos slow technological (and many other forms of) progress to a glacial pace in many government settings.</p>

<p>I once spent valuable time collecting requirements for a piece of vital software, researching and recommending a reasonably priced and effective off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<p>Instead, someone decided to shoehorn the new use case into an aging enterprise software suite that had never seemed anything more than an ugly utilitarian GUI on top of a fancy backend of connected spreadsheets.</p>

<p>There was no line-item cost to the shoehorn solution, so it naturally looked like a winner when it came to budgeting. But the person-hours wasted reinventing the wheel easily outweighed the out-of-pocket cost of the solution I had proposed.</p>

<p>And aside from cost, persons in positions of power are often averse to being educated by twenty-somethings. That is especially true when it comes to technology, which most leaders know is important but few truly understand.</p>

<p>Budgets and egos.</p>

<p>Anyway, go read the rest of the article. It looks like Mr. Headd replies to comments, so it&#8217;s worth asking him any questions you might have.</p></div>
