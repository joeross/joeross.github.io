<a href='http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/serial_sarah_koenig_adnan_syed.php'>Serial podcast presents novel collision of law and technology</a><div class="link_description"><p>The incredible true crime podcast <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/" target="_blank">Serial</a> presents a novel collision between technology and the law. This time, it&#8217;s not that technology plays or should play a particular part in the case itself, but that a podcast has shed light on a cold case that may lead to an unexpected outcome.</p>

<p>The podcast&#8217;s producers interviewed Deirdre Enright, director of the University of Virginia School of Law&#8217;s <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/academics/practical/innocenceclinic.htm" target="_blank">Innocence Project</a> for <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/season-one/7/the-opposite-of-the-prosecution" target="_blank">Episode 7</a>.</p>

<p>Lindsay Beyerstein reports at the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UVA Innocence Project is poised to ask a court to test an old physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) that was used on Leeâ€™s body to test for possible sexual assault in 1999 but was never tested for DNA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DNA is an issue that might never have come up but for the Serial producers&#8217; interview with Professor Enright. It&#8217;s the first instance I&#8217;ve heard of where a podcast may directly affect the outcome of a legal case. And considering the defendant, Syed, has already been sentenced to life in prison, any change at all to his sentence, let alone total exoneration, would be unexpected and important.</p>

<p>It implicates a power to uncover truth in cold cases heretofore reserved primarily to outfits like Professor Enright&#8217;s. What&#8217;s even more compelling to me is that Serial mixes the modern technology of podcasting with the very old style of serial storytelling. The whole thing exposes how, increasingly, the law benefits from ancillary developments in journalism and technology. It&#8217;ll be fascinating to hear the ultimate outcome when we get there.</p></div>
