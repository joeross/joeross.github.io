<a href='http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/30/coast-guard-visits-mysterious-google-barge/3318347/'>Google "zealously" private about mystery barge</a><div class="link_description"><p>I thought this was interesting but not really worth mentioning here, until the Coast Guard visited, apparently, as USA Today reports, under a presumably Google-imposed gag order.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an avid Google user, incredibly open on the internet, and something of an apologist for the utility of systems that know a ton about me. But I still think it&#8217;s rich that, as Michael Winters writes in the article, Google &#8220;is zealously guarding its privacy&#8221; around the barge.</p>

<p><span>So rich.Â </span></p>

<p>UPDATE: It&#8217;s a party barge. <a href="http://joeross.me/post/65711282580/googles-party-barge" target="_self">No, seriously</a>.</p></div>
