Flatley at <em>The Verge</em> is a feat of modern reporting and storytelling. Do yourself a favor and watch the associated documentary, too.</p>

<p>I like to give everything a &#8220;link&#8221; / &#8220;longread&#8221; category and one other that describes the content. This one covers a topic I won&#8217;t likely post about often, so I&#8217;m filing it under &#8220;journalism&#8221; because, again, it&#8217;s just that good.</p></div>
