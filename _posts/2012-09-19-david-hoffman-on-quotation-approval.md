<a href='http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2012/09/quote-approval.html'>David Hoffman on quotation approval</a><div class="link_description"><p>Two days ago, I <a href="http://joeross.me/post/31747778284/david-carr-on-quotation-approval" target="_blank">mentioned</a> a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/business/media/the-puppetry-of-quotation-approval.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">piece by David Carr</a> on quotation approval. This morning, I found that Professor David Hoffman, whose corporate law class I took at Temple Law, had posted his own thoughts at <em>Concurring Opinions</em>.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Specifically, this part stuck out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a simple reason that most sources (including me) ask for quote approval: we don’t trust reporters to avoid making a hash out of our comments, pulling quotes selectively to fit a pre-existing narrative, and consequently turning the source into the reporter’s sock puppet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Hoffman&#8217;s reaction illustrates an important distinction that we need to make in thinking about the integrity of quote approval. I think that experts have a right to approve not only their quotes, but the context in which those quotes will appear.</p>

<p>After all, a journalist&#8217;s use of an expert extends beyond the quote, and can be honest or manipulative depending on the integrity of the journalist in question. The press <em>seeks</em> quotes from experts like Professor Hoffman, and I believe their seeking creates an obligation to accurately report not only the words but the context.</p>

<p>However, David Carr&#8217;s thesis on the problem with quote approval holds true when those approvals are coming from public relations departments or firms, campaigns, or others who actively <em>seek</em> press coverage. The difference is between controlling the narrative (in the case of PR) and ensuring accurate context (in the case of experts).</p></div>
