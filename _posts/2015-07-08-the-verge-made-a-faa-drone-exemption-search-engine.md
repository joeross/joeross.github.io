[The Verge made a FAA drone exemption search engine](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8883821/drone-search-engine-faa-approved-commercial-333-exemptions)

Ben Popper reports at *The Verge*:

> We have partnered with the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College to collect data on every commercial exemption the FAA grants. It's a fascinating snapshot of a fast-growing industry still in its infancy. [The result] is an interactive database that allows you to drill deeper into details, exploring the companies that have been given permission to fly and what they are planning to do with their drones. You can also search by state and figure out who near you is planning to put a drone in the sky.
