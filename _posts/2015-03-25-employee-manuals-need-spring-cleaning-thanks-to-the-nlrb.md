[Employee Manuals Need Spring Cleaning Thanks to the NLRB](http://www.michiganemploymentlawadvisor.com/employment-agreements/employee-manuals-need-spring-cleaning-thanks-to-the-nlrb/)

Jason Shinn, writing at *Michigan Employment Law Advisor*:

> But this is where employers really need to be concerned: The distinction between what is permissible and what is not is somewhat anemic to begin with, and if your companyâ€™s policies are too broad or poorly worded, then whatever distinction existed may be obliterated. 

The full report is available [in PDF format](http://www.michiganemploymentlawadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/341/2015/03/NLRB-Report-of-the-General-Counsel-Concerning-Employer-Rules.pdf). The National Labor Relations Act is a federal law, and Section 7 applies whether or not employees are unionized. That means, as Shinn advises in the article, that every company with employees of any kind should perform a revision of their HR policies and procedures.
