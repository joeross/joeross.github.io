<a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/12/are-your-internal-systems-damaging-your-business/'>Millenials won't use subpar enterprise software</a><div class="link_description"><p>Paul Boag writes at Smashing Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frustration will only increase as millennials enter the workforce. These people are digital natives, and they expect a certain standard of software. They expect software to adapt to them, not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My generation were loud about the outdated software our employers used. We begged, insisted and shouted from the rooftops that efficient workload management demanded a higher level of polish, functionality and user experience.</p>

<p>Even massive software makers like Oracle do little if anything post-sale to ensure their products get the design and functionality upgrades they so desperately need. You can pay an army of contractor-consultants to customize the database architecture and processing flow, sure, but the interface is still all &#8217;90s.</p>

<p>That was then, though. Today, the up-and-comers are just as unlikely to accept awful software and user experience. The difference is they won&#8217;t <em>ask</em> or <em>shout</em> at all, they just start using third-party tools. Sometimes this is fine, but other times there are serious security concerns with using third-party software for company work.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/12/are-your-internal-systems-damaging-your-business/" target="_blank">Boag&#8217;s article</a>, especially if you manage any young folks, because this stuff is happening and you should take the opportunity to learn from them. They&#8217;re going to gravitate toward good user experience and efficiency, and that&#8217;s good for business.</p></div>
