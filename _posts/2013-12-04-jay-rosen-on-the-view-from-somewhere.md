<a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/a-news-organization-that-rejects-the-view-from-nowhere/281979/'>Jay Rosen on the "View from Somewhere"</a><div class="link_description"><p>The quarter-billion-dollar news company Pierre Omidyar is founding will be fascinating: a digital-first journalism outfit with old media money behind it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an odd flip of the Jeff Bezos/Washington Post <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bezos-i-got-talked-into-buying-the-washington-post-2013-12" target="_blank">play</a>, which involved a digital-first entrepreneur putting the same money as Omidyar, $250M, behind an old media organization.</p>

<p>If I had more free time, there would be a good article in there somewhere about what exactly it means to see that kind of money converging on the old/new media dichotomy from opposite directions.</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t, so there won&#8217;t. For now, at least.</p></div>
