<a href='http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/01/29Apple-Increases-iPad-with-Retina-Display-to-128GB.html?utm_source=loopinsight.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Feed: loopinsight/KqJb (The Loop)'>The 128 GB iPad is official...</a><div class="link_description"><p>&#8230;but I&#8217;m not interested.</p>

<p>Peter Cohen of <em>The Loop</em> <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/01/29/apple-confirms-new-128gb-ipad-coming-next-week/" target="_blank">shared this</a> earlier today, but I wonder why he didn&#8217;t offer any of his own thoughts on it. Here&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not interested:</p>

<p>Part of the iPad&#8217;s appeal to me is that it isn&#8217;t another crufty &#8220;filing cabinet.&#8221; I rather like that it is exactly what it appears to be: a big, beautiful window into the cloud. Everything I need is in Dropbox or Rdio or Google or Evernote, and when I make something, whether or not I&#8217;m connected to the internet, there&#8217;s always a way to save it for later synchronization. I also find that limited space makes me more discerning when it comes to installing apps, or choosing what music will sync to the device.</p>

<p>I understand some people lust after the one-terabyte tablet. I will never be one of those people.</p></div>
