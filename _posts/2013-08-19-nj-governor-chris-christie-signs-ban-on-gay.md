<a href='http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_23893035/'>NJ governor Chris Christie signs ban on gay conversion therapy</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is good news, make no mistake about it. But <a href="http://joeross.me/post/36738514496/gay-conversion-snake-oil-salesmen-taken-to-court" target="_blank">as I said about a similar ban in California</a>, this law does nothing to prevent &#8220;religious counselors&#8221; from abusing children by attempting to change their sexual preferences.</p>

<p>And as for the parental rights issue, no parent has the right to subject their children to psychological abuse merely to appease that parent&#8217;s fear, ignorance or hatred.</p>

<p>I am not religious, but I respect those who use religion in ethically reasonable ways to help others and themselves. Conversion therapy and those who support it are an embarrassment to to the many legitimate social outreach efforts made by the Christian and other churches all the time.</p></div>
