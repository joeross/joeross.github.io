<a href='http://wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-34255'>You don't have to tweet for Twitter to consider you an active user</a><div class="link_description"><p>Yoree Koh reporting at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter said it has 241 million monthly active users the last three months of 2013. Twitter defines a monthly active user as an account that logs in at least once a month. By Twitterâ€™s standards, a person does not have to tweet to be considered a monthly active user.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would think <em>active</em> users <em>tweet</em> and <em>passive</em> users only <em>read</em>. If I was considered an active user of every platform I sign into in a month, I would be considered far more active than I really am.</p></div>
