This week we have a disturbing mix of Facebook threats, chicken rumors, domestic government spyplanes and data breaches.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elonis&rsquo; Facebook posts, written in the form of rap lyrics, talked about killing his wife, knifing an female FBI agent and shooting schoolchildren.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ruling makes little sense to me in the era of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy">Gamergate</a>, which has resulted in bomb threats and worse. Part of the Court&#39;s reasoning&nbsp;&quot;was that Elonis needed to be aware of the threatening nature of his communication in order to be convicted.&quot; I&#39;ve been following this case for a while, and it seems pretty obvious that he intended his communication to be threatening and was aware that it was threatening.&nbsp;Read more about the case if you want to make your own ruling over at <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/elonis-v-united-states/">SCOTUSBlog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>KFC is suing three companies for allegedly spreading rumors about the quality of its food, including that its chickens have eight legs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The unfortunate thing is that while claims that its chickens have six wings and eight legs may have damaged KFC&#39;s brand in China, I suspect Americans would ask why they didn&#39;t have eight wings and ten legs...</p>

<h2 id="-fbi-behind-mysterious-surveillance-aircraft-over-us-cities-http-hosted-ap-org-dynamic-stories-u-us_fbi_surveillance_flights-section-home-site-vacha-template-default-"><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_FBI_SURVEILLANCE_FLIGHTS?SECTION=HOME&SITE=VACHA&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">FBI behind mysterious surveillance aircraft over US cities</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The AP traced at least 50 aircraft back to the FBI, and identified more than 100 flights in 11 states over a 30-day period since late April, orbiting both major cities and rural areas. At least 115 planes, including 90 Cessna aircraft, were mentioned in a federal budget document from 2009.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I fear this disclosure is going to stoke the fires of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail_conspiracy_theory">chemtrails conspiracy</a>. Even if the tin-foil hats remain in the digital shadows, the information isn&#39;t going to help federal law enforcement recover from its post-Snowden loss of credibility, whether that loss was ever deserved or not (and I think much of the animus aimed at the intelligence community is undeserved).&nbsp;</p>

Secretly Expands Internet Spying at U.S. Border</a></h2>

<blockquote style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">
<p>The disclosures, based on documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, and shared with The New York Times and ProPublica, come at a time of unprecedented cyberattacks on American financial institutions, businesses and government agencies, but also of greater scrutiny of secret legal justifications for broader government surveillance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federal lawyers spend a lot of time researching and writing memoranda that serve as &quot;green lights&quot; for various policy implementation plans of the current administration. Again, I&#39;m not as skeptical and paranoid about intelligence agencies as some are, but perhaps President Obama should have been more muted about transparency in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/remarks-president-cybersecurity-and-consumer-protection-summit">his recent speech at Stanford</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the breach, detected in April at the Office of Personnel Management. The agency essentially functions as the federal government&rsquo;s human resources department, managing background checks, pension payments and job training across dozens of federal agencies.</p>

<p>Hack me once, shame on you. Hack me <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/10/5888115/chinese-hackers-us-government-employees-database">twice in as many years</a>, shame on the Office of Personnel Management. If you know any federal employees, make sure they&#39;re aware of this.</p>
