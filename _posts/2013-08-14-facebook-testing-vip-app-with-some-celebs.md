<a href='http://allthingsd.com/20130813/fame-on-facebook-testing-vip-only-app/'>Facebook Testing VIP App With Some Celebs</a><div class="link_description"><p>In case you thought I was becoming a Facebook fanboy, let me just say that this celeb crap is something Zuck will be adding to his list of regrets within the year.</p>

<p>Granted, that&#8217;s probably a very short list, but this VIP thing is a distraction an a gimmick and it&#8217;s going nowhere.</p>

<p>And yes, I&#8217;m prepared to try some claim chowder if I&#8217;m wrong. I&#8217;m just pretty confident I&#8217;m not.</p></div>
