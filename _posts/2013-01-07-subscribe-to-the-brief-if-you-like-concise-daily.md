<a href='http://thebrief.io/2013/introducing-memberships/'>Subscribe to The Brief if you like concise daily updates on the tech news that matters</a><div class="link_description"><p>The ads weren&#8217;t working, so <em>The Brief</em> is now accepting $3/month or $30/year memberships. The incredibly useful site by <a href="http://nostri.ch/" target="_blank">Richard Dunlop-Walters</a> will remain free to all, but it&#8217;s continued existence is now predicated upon a sufficient number of its 3,000-plus current and future subscribers paying for a membership.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s well worth it, especially if you&#8217;re overwhelmed by RSS feeds, newsletters, and social networks as sources of technology news.</p></div>
