<p>A former Apple employee, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/apple-siri-disappointment/" target="_blank">talking to <em>Wired</em>'s Christina Bonnington</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People are embarrassed by Siri,” a former Apple employee told Fortune. “Steve would have lost his mind over Siri.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t know, or care very much, whether that anonymous Apple employee is right or wrong about what Steve Jobs would say about Siri today. But there is a reason Android handset marketers have never focused on <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/" target="_blank">Voice Actions</a> in television commercials and other advertisements:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a great feature. It&#8217;s <em>good</em>, but definitely not great.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s something best left to the phone&#8217;s packaging, or even the user manual. It&#8217;s something you read about, &#8220;Control your Android phone just by speaking using Voice Actions,&#8221; and automatically assume the worst.</p>

<p>Even that line from the official website oversells Voice Actions, but like I said, no one is pushing the feature in marketing materials.</p>

<p>What about Siri, though?</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Let me be clear: I&#8217;m not talking about the law suits filed alleging false advertising or whatever it is they&#8217;re alleging. I&#8217;m talking purely about user experience. Let&#8217;s see how Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html" target="_blank">Siri landing page</a> describes the service (bolding is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Siri on iPhone 4S lets you use your voice to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more. <strong>Ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk.</strong> Siri understands what you say, knows what you mean, and even talks back. Siri is so easy to use and does so much, you’ll keep finding more and more ways to use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use an Android phone, but I&#8217;ve played with Siri and I&#8217;ve talked to people who (used to) try to use it. The results are clear:</p>

<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> &#8220;ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>You <strong>can</strong> ask Siri to do <em>some</em> things just by talking <em>sort of like</em> the way you talk.</p>

<p>I love Google Voice Actions, and I absolutely concede that Siri <em>can</em> be wonderful, too. But services that are so dependent on the user&#8217;s input for the experience they provide do not lend themselves to standard hyperbolic marketing. It&#8217;s too easy to overshoot, raise consumer expections to unattainable heights, and produce what feels like a flop.</p>

<p>Like Siri.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s <em>modus operandi</em> is to design and build beautiful, simple products to make life easier and more enjoyable. They are accustomed to marketing things that make people line up around the block, and that&#8217;s how they marketed Siri.</p>

<p>But no one who has tried it would line up around the block for it. No amount of celebrity commercials can change that. Apple needs to iterate quickly and get the &#8220;beta&#8221; out from behind Siri&#8217;s name, and out of the typical user&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p>I suspect that if they <em>stopped</em> marketing the hell out of Siri and just produced an update to make it as &#8220;magical&#8221; as they have led users to believe it is, they&#8217;d get more press and consumer goodwill than any ad campaign can buy.</p>
