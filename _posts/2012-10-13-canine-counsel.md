<a href='http://savannahnow.com/effingham-now/2012-10-11/attorney-appointed-dog-attacked-child'>Canine counsel</a><div class="link_description"><p>DeAnn Komanecky, writing for the <em>Savannah Morning News</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judge William E, Woodrum Jr. “in the interest of justice” appointed Springfield attorney Claude M. Kicklighter to represent the dog, named Kno.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not unheard of, but the facts in this case (a five-year old, severely injured child) make it surprising that the judge specified counsel was to represent the dog&#8217;s interests, in addition to those of the parents. It sounds like a petty grisly injury to a very sympathetic individual.</p>

<p>The general approach to pets in the law, although it differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, is that they are property, and therefore without any &#8220;interests&#8221; of their own as the term is used in the law. Attacks often lead to euthanasia, sometimes compulsory under local law. The hearing in this case will determine whether or not the dog is euthanized.</p></div>
