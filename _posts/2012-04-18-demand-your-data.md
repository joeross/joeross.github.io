  <p>Whatever social site, wherever you put your data, you should make sure that you can get it back and get it back in a standard form. And in fact if I were you I would do that regularly, just like you back up your computer â€¦ maybe our grandchildren depending on which website we use may or may not be able to see our photos.</p>

<p>This is exactly what has me seriously considering something even more &#8220;liberated&#8221; than <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress.org</a> for my post-Posterous blog. Right now, I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://scriptogr.am" target="_blank">Scriptogr.am</a>, and it&#8217;s very promising. Write posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, save to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, and Scriptogr.am turns them into HTML. Scriptogr.am even has a bookmarklet, just like Posterous, Wordpress and the rest.</p>
