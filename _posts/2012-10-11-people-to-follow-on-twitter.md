<a href='https://whotheyfollow.herokuapp.com/'>People to Follow on Twitter</a><div class="link_description"><p>Nate Kontny <a href="http://ninjasandrobots.com/people-to-follow-on-twitter" target="_blank">recently announced</a> his creation of a little tool to copy the people someone follows on Twitter to your own private list. People to Follow essentially, as Kontny explains, clones someone&#8217;s &#8220;followees&#8221; list.</p>

<p>It looks like it maxes out at 100, but it&#8217;s still an interesting way to get a peek at someone&#8217;s timeline.</p></div>
