<a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/3014821/will-foursquare-ceo-dennis-crowley-finally-get-it-right'>Fast Company's Austin Carr profiles Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley</a><div class="link_description"><p>This profile of Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley by Austin Carr at <em>Fast Company</em> does a great job of humanizing the app and its maker.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s probably because the man behind the location-sharing and, more recently, stuff-to-do discovery app, has put so much of himself into Foursquare. There are many profiles written about business and tech personalities, but few intrigued as much as this one does.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s because Carr really communicates how Crowley is finding himself at a cross-roads not only with Foursquare as a company, but with his life&#8217;s direction and essence.</p></div>
