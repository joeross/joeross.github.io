  <p>It’s getting easier for designers to become engineers. That’s a good thing, but it should be even easier. Design should be the hard part.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great post, and something I think about often. I can read and write a lot of HTML and CSS, and can read some JavaScript. I don&#8217;t know anything about design, but I&#8217;m confident in my ability to avoid ugly mistakes by putting as much consideration into what I <em>don&#8217;t</em> include as I do into what I <em>do</em> include.</p>

<p>As an aside, Medium is a beautiful site with consistently solid content by thoughtful and articulate people.</p></div>
