<a href='https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/why-sen-feinstein-wrong-about-whos-real-reporter'>Legislative failure to define essential terms</a><div class="link_description"><pre></pre>

<p>The definition of terms essential to the application of a law is the most basic requirement for competent lawmaking.</p>

<p>Sometimes one or more terms are appropriately defined in an open way, to provide flexibility in the application of a law. This is not one of one laws.  The shield law is meant to protect reporters, so defining what exactly a reporter is should be done wi surgical precision.</p>

<p>I am open to arguing how broad or narrow the definition of journalist should be in a shield law, but that conversation but result in a specific outcome that is codified in the new law.</p>

<p>It is impossible to have that discussion and achieve that specific codification when legislators shirk their fundamental responsibility.</p>

<p>As Morgan Weiland of the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains in the article linked above, Senators Feinstein and Durbin, and all the legislators who contributed to the poorly-drafted law, have failed in their duty to their constituents and the rest of our country. Hopefully a competent legislator will step in to correct their shortcomings as the law progresses.</p>
