<a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/02/tim_armstrong_blames_distressed_babies_for_aol_benefit_cuts_he_s_talking.single.html'>$12M CEO vs. $1M baby</a><div class="link_description"><p>The wife of an AOL employee, commenting on the company&#8217;s chief executive using her child&#8217;s premature birth as an example of why the company was cutting benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a “distressed baby” who cost the company too much money. How he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits. How he exposed the most searing experience of our lives, one that my husband and I still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other, for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The view from the top is one of digits and dollar signs, not daughters and dignity.</p></div>
