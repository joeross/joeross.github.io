<a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/precog-software-predicts-crime/'>UPenn criminologist Richard Berk's recidivism-prediction algorithm</a><div class="link_description"><p><em>Wired</em>'s Kim Zetter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To create the software, researchers assembled a dataset of more than 60,000 crimes, including homicides, then wrote an algorithm to find the people behind the crimes who were more likely to commit murder when paroled or put on probation. Berk claims the software could identify eight future murderers out of 100.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating concept, but read the article to find out why it may have some critics.</p></div>
