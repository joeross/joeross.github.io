<a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/how-facebook-designs-the-perfect-empty-vessel-for-your-mind/275426/'>The Perfect Empty Vessel</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is a good piece on how hard Facebook tries to keep the social juices flowing. Alexis Madrigal, commenting on Facebook&#8217;s designer-hiring spree:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As all these designers vanish into the bowels of the company, so, too, does their work. Facebook wants to create design that both allows and guides behavior without calling attention to itself. And what works in the Deep South must also work in southern India and South America. It must work for 16-year-olds and 86-year-olds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the primary reason Facebook makes me uncomfortable: it&#8217;s <em>too</em> generic. Sometimes I <em>want</em> a service to be just a little in my way. I realize that you can&#8217;t generalize my preferences to hundreds of millions of people, but that just means I&#8217;ll never really feel awesome about using Facebook.</p>

<p>It feels like it&#8217;s been crafted as simply the most efficient way for me to send targeting data to advertisers&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;because it has.</p></div>
