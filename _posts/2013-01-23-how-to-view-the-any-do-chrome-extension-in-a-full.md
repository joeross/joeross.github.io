<p>I complained (okay, <a href="http://joeross.me/post/38230036920/any-do-declines-google-tasks-auto-sync-request" target="_blank">more like whined&#8230;</a>) in December that <a href="http://Any.DO" target="_blank">Any.DO</a> was rejecting <a href="http://anydoandroid.uservoice.com/forums/166919-general/suggestions/3003697-auto-sync-all-changes-with-google-tasks" target="_blank">user requests</a> for auto-sync with <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/" target="_blank">Google Tasks</a>. I&#8217;ve since come to use Any.DO full time, after trying it a while ago, loving it, being distracted by <a href="http://astrid.com" target="_blank">Astrid</a> and <a href="http://www.wunderlist.com" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a>, and coming back for the simultaneously unique and intuitive user interface.</p>

<p>I signed up a while ago to be notified when Any.DO launches their web interface. While their <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anydo/kdadialhpiikehpdeejjeiikopddkjem" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a> is robust, I don&#8217;t really enjoy poking around in a pop-up that truncates most of my task names. Both Astrid and Wunderlist already have web interfaces, but I&#8217;ve always preferred Any.DO.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I decided to poke around in the code behind Any.DO&#8217;s Chrome extension. I&#8217;m not an expert, but I&#8217;m knowledgeable enough to go in and pull out the Chrome address for the extension itself. If you have already installed the extension, <a href="//kdadialhpiikehpdeejjeiikopddkjem//index.html" target="_blank">this link</a> will open it in a full browser tab of its own, thus eliminating the truncated-tasks problem.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a proper web interface, since it doesn&#8217;t work unless the extension is installed, but feels close enough to hold me over until they release the real deal.</p>
