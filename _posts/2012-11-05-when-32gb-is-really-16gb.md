<a href='http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/11/05/microsofts-new-tune-only-have-16gb-open-on-that-32gb-surface-not-more-than-20gb-as-promised/'>When 32GB is really 16GB...</a><div class="link_description"><p>Microsoft is taking heat for claiming more user-available disk space on its new ARM-based Windows 8-powered Surface tablet than is really there.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for a long time. Most companies are lying in their commercials, product pages, and press releases when it comes to how much disk space their gadgets offer users. This isn&#8217;t as big a deal for the kind of person who reads Alex Wilhelm at <em>The Next Web</em>. But for my parents, looking to buy a tablet, it is a non-trivial deception.</p>

<p>The deception actually works <em>against</em> the companies that use it: I suggest that many people may consider the larger model if the true size of the smaller model were more apparent.</p></div>
