<a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/3036073/the-creepiest-new-corner-of-instagram-role-playing-with-stolen-baby-photos?utm_campaign=home&amp;utm_source=tumblr&amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;partner=tumblr'>Anonymous Instagram users role-play with stolen baby photos</a><div class="link_description"><p>Blake Miller of <em>Fast Company</em> has this chilling article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jenny had become a victim of a growing&#8212;and to many, alarming&#8212;new community that exists primarily on Instagram: baby role-players. Instagram users like Nikki steal images of babies and children off the Internet, give them a new name, and claim them as their own. Sometimes they create entire fake families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sad thing is there is relatively little protection to be had from the law in situations like this. You may be able to sue someone using your likeness in a commercial venture without your permission, but non-commercial use of the nature described above is rarely protected in the same way.</p>

<p>Instagram users should review their privacy settings by reading the company&#8217;s help pages about <a href="https://help.instagram.com/116024195217477/" target="_blank">controlling your visibility</a> and setting photos and video as <a href="https://help.instagram.com/448523408565555" target="_blank">viewable only to approved followers</a>.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind, though: even if you set your content as private, sharing a link to a photo or video on a social network like Twitter or Facebook will allow <em>anyone with that link</em> to view it.</p>

<p>People who do steal your photos and pretend they&#8217;re your child or your child&#8217;s parent are violating Instagram&#8217;s <a href="http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, which prohibits impersonation, among other things (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must not defame, stalk, bully, abuse, harass, threaten, <strong>impersonate</strong> or intimidate people or entities [&#8230;]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Fast Company</em> article to which I link above includes a statement from Instagram that the company does remove the stolen images when users report such activity.</p>

<p>This story is another lesson to be mindful of not only what you share online, but how you share it. After all, a private company like Instagram could simply choose to ignore concerns like these, and users would have no recourse. Social networks can be a rich and vibrant way to stay in touch, but we are all responsible for what and how we share.</p></div>
