<blockquote>
  <p>As the markets get more saturated, the pressure will be much stronger to add more screen sizes.</p>
  
  <p>"Today, the answer is no," he said. "Down the road, the answer is yes," he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No way.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>The only source of pressure on Apple to do anything is the company&#8217;s own design language and direction. If they ever made iPhones with larger screens, it would be for their own reasons, like maybe the retina display deserves a slightly larger screen on which to show off its awesomeness.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s already the iPad for that.</p>

<p>It <em>won&#8217;t</em> <strong>ever</strong> be to reach &#8220;lower-cost segments&#8221; like another analyst told Yang, because Apple&#8217;s strategy for that is to slice the price of older iPhone models to the bone whenever a new one comes out. <em>There&#8217;s</em> your lower-cost segment. They&#8217;ve been doing it for some time now, with narry a &gt; 3.5 inch screen in sight.</p>
