<a href='http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/with-comcast-time-warner-merger-looming-att-will-acquire-directtv/'>AT&amp;T, acquiring DirectTV, "vows" to stick to FCC's Open Internet rules for 3 years</a><div class="link_description"><p>Nathan Mattise, reporting at <em>Ars Technica</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two companies will demonstrate &#8220;continued commitment for three years after closing to the FCC&#8217;s Open Internet protections established in 2010, irrespective of whether the FCC re-establishes such protections for other industry participants following the DC Circuit Court of Appeals vacating those rules.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first draft of this post was cynical and incredulous, as I <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/post/86589962194/comcast-says-its-data-caps-arent-data-caps" target="_blank">am wont to be</a>. But on second thought, it would behoove AT&amp;T to stick to it&#8217;s &#8220;vow,&#8221; if for no other reason than to grease the skids for regulatory approval of the deal. Like I <a href="/post/84847936626/moves-contradicting-previous-statement-may-share-user" target="_blank">said about Moves and Facebook</a>, it&#8217;s hard to blame a company for seeking growth.</p>

<p>While the FCC&#8217;s Open Internet rules have been struck down since they were first imposed in 2010, Comcast still abides by those rules pursuant to requirements <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/nbcuniversal-transaction" target="_blank">imposed by the FCC</a> on its purchase of NBCUniversal.</p>

<p>Now that those rules have been struck down, and we&#8217;re in limbo while a new rules proposal <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5720730/how-to-comment-on-fcc-net-neutrality-proposal" target="_blank">goes through its comment period</a>, AT&amp;T committing to the Comcast restrictions presumes the FCC will have similar concerns about their purchase of DirecTV. So the worst case scenario for AT&amp;T is that the FCC achieves similar restrictions via the new rules, in which case AT&amp;T is already prepared. And the best case scenario is that the new rules are more lenient than the 2010 rules, and AT&amp;T is even happier.</p>

<p>In fact, the only losers here are consumers. While there is some question about whether this consolidation in the connectivity/content space will cause <em>immediate</em> market overlap and thus a significant reduction in local competition, it&#8217;s hard to see how things will get better for consumers as a result of this vertical integration over time.</p></div>
