## Introduction

I'm a couple hours late this week so I'm going to keep the intro brief. I want to give a shout-out to my sister Brenda, who's preparing for nursing boards because she lacks the misanthropy I've been cultivating in myself for 32 years now.

Also, part of my Dad's Father's Day present is that I've included a sports story in this week's edition. Sure, I'm a bit snarky about it, but it's there, so enjoy.

## [Who Has Your Back? Government Data Requests 2015](https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015)

Nine companies maxed out on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's rating system, but two cellular providers disappointed. I didn't quote anything here because it's worth reading the whole report. There's no one reading this newsletter that doesn't use at least one of the services EFF evaluated, so the details matter to us all. 

## [St. Louis Cardinals Investigated by F.B.I. for Hacking Astros](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/sports/baseball/st-louis-cardinals-hack-astros-fbi.html)

> The F.B.I. and Justice Department prosecutors are investigating front-office officials for the St. Louis Cardinals, one of the most successful teams in baseball over the past two decades, for hacking into the internal networks of a rival team to steal closely guarded information about player personnel.

It's rare that sportsball (that's what it's called, right?) intersects with anything I'm even remotely interested in (sorry Dad). It's also funny that the press has consistently used the word "hack" to describe what amounts to one team's operations team learning the password of a former employee of the other team. That's hacking about as much as having hit thea baseball exactly *one time* roughly *20 years ago* makes me a National League All-Star. 

Despite the amateur-hour nature of this "hack," it's not impossible to make an argument that one or more people violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the federal law making it illegal to access a computer or network you aren't authorized to access. But for now go read [this piece by Michael Baumann at *Grantland*](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2015-mlb-st-louis-cardinals-houston-astros-fbi-hacking-investigation/) for a combination of fun and seriousness about this incident. 

## [Amazon insists federal rules apply to U.S. deliveries by drone](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/us-usa-drones-amazon-com-idUSKBN0OW2RB20150616)

> Amazon.com, seeking to bolster its efforts to deliver products via drone, said on Tuesday that states and local communities should not be allowed to regulate unmanned aerial systems (UAS) authorized by federal aviation regulators.

This is important to the company because if localities are allowed to impose their own regulations Amazon will be stuck trying to comply with 50 different state regimes and a potentially massive amount of city and township rules. They already deal with this problem with regard to sales tax but the difference here is they are out ahead of any finalized rules. 

## [Put Lawyers Where They're Needed](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/opinion/put-lawyers-where-theyre-needed.html)

> This "justice gap" is vast. According to the World Justice Project's latest Rule of Law Index, which gathers primary data on people's practical experience of the law in 102 countries, the United States ranks 65th for the accessibility and affordability of its civil justice. We're tied with Botswana, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, not far behind Moldova and Nigeria.

This *New York Times* Op-Ed Theresa Amato, the author of the forthcoming book “Liberated Lawyering: How Lawyers Can Change the World,” explains how insufficient support for public interest lawyering damages communities and the profession itself.

## [Follow-up: Major Rikers Island Reforms Head To Federal Court](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/19/rikers-island-jail-reforms-deal_n_7621738.html)

> The lawsuit, Nunez v. City of New York, alleges "unnecessary and excessive force inflicted upon inmates" and cites multiple incidents of officers brutally beating people held at Rikers to the point of needing surgery.

Last week I wrote about the [suicide of Kalief Browder](http://joeross.me/blog/articles/modern-law-for-the-week-ending-june-12-2015/), who spent three years at Rikers without a trial (the charges against him were eventually dismissed). This week, attorneys on both sides agreed to terms that a federal judge must still approve before they go into effect.
