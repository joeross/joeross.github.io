<a href='http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/antitrustprof_blog/2012/10/supreme-court-will-address-antitrust-state-action-exemption.html'>Supreme Court Will Address Antitrust State Action Exemption</a><div class="link_description"><p>Steve Semeraro at the <em>Antitrust &amp; Competition Policy Blog</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Government actors are charged with a duty to act in the public interest and thus can generally be trusted to restrain trade only when the public will benefit. Private actors, by contrast, are driven by the desire to maximize profit and will thus restrain trade when it is privately beneficial but harms the public interest. On 26 November, the Supreme Court will reenter the fray, hearing oral argument in <em>FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting part of antitrust law: the exemption from antitrust liability for state actors and, in very limited circumstances, private actors acting under the supervision of the state. These issues are more relevant than you may think if you&#8217;re not a law student/lawyer/professor/large-scale businessperson.</p>
