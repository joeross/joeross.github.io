<a href='http://allthingsd.com/20120914/twitters-loss-in-occupy-case-will-make-a-lot-of-companies-nervous/'>Twitter forced to turn over protester's deleted tweets</a><div class="link_description"><p>Mike Isaac, writing at <em>All Things D</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the end, the New York DA and the judge used a legal maneuver to put pressure on Twitter, threatening to hold the company in contempt of court and levy steep fines if it didnâ€™t hand over the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#8217;t say they didn&#8217;t try.</p>

<p>They have even appealed the judge&#8217;s threat to hold them in contempt. The envelope&#8212;yes, a physical envelope&#8212;containing the tweets at issue will remain sealed until that appeal is complete.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://joeross.me/post/30453483953/twitter-files-appeal-in-major-social-media-case" target="_blank">said it before</a>: it may not be a good time to be a third-party Twitter developer, but the company truly goes to bat for its users when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p></div>
