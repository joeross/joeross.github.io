Why Not Dogs?</a><div class="link_description"><p>What a good survey of animal law, where it came from, where it is and where it&#8217;s going. A pleasant surprise, as I usually write off Huffington Post pretty fast.</p>

<p>The only people that argue against the treatment of dogs, and other animals, as more than property are those who have never experienced the profound bond that develops between a human and a pet.</p>

<p>But the ASPCA efforts are the ones to watch here. Their moderate approach is more palatable to the establishment and therefore more effective in the long-term than the jarring advocacy of more extreme groups like PETA.</p></div>
