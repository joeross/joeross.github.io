<a href='http://nytimes.com/2014/07/29/us/spending-big-to-fight-big-donors.html'>Larry Lessig fighting for campaign finance reform with Mayday PAC</a><div class="link_description"><p>Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s <a href="https://mayday.us" target="_blank">Mayday PAC</a> is using the very system it decries to attempt to bring that system down. In other words, Lessig et al are hijacking the virus (the influence of big donors on American politics via election contributions) to deliver the vaccine (funding for politicians committed to proposals which would limit big political contributions).</p>

<p>If you support the cause, be heartened: Lessig <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/27/226834651/record-label-picks-a-fight-over-copyright-with-the-wrong-guy" target="_blank">likes to fight</a>, and is good at it.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t support the cause, it&#8217;s probably time to start taking Mayday seriously. Your candidate&#8217;s job may depend on it.</p></div>
