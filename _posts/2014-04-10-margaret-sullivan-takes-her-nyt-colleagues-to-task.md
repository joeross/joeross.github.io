<a href='http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/author/margaret-sullivan/'>Margaret Sullivan takes her NYT colleagues to task like it's her job, because it is</a><div class="link_description"><p>Margaret Sullivan is Public Editor at the <em>New York Times</em>. She is tasked with taking the Times to task when it falls short, overreaches or otherwise misses the mark.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>And sometimes it does miss the mark, like when it <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/times-should-have-nodded-to-wall-street-journal-in-medicare-story/" target="_blank">failed to mention successful litigation</a> by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> which resulted in publication of Medicare data the <em>Times</em> used in crafting a recent feature story.</p>

<p>Sullivan’s candor and diligence are a service to the paper’s readers and reporters alike. Subscribe to her RSS feed <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/feed/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>
