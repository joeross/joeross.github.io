<a href='http://blog.feedly.com/2012/09/14/the-new-feedly-mobile-ios-and-android/'>The New Feedly Mobile</a><div class="link_description"><p><em><strong>Anti-disclosure:</strong> This post raves about the new Feedly. They didn&#8217;t pay me, I don&#8217;t know them, and all I get out of writing the below is the satisfaction of pointing fellow Android users to one of the best-designed apps in the Play Store.</em></p>

<hr><p>I <em>love</em> both <a href="http://www.pulse.me" target="_blank">Pulse</a> and <a href="http://www.flipboard.com" target="_blank">Flipboard</a> and I can&#8217;t think of many ways I would improve them. They&#8217;re elegant and functional, which are really important descriptors in my mind when it comes to app design. But they feel best to me on a tablet. Both use interface paradigms (buzz word!) that just feel (again, to me) a little overwrought on most mobile phone displays.</p>

<p>I uninstalled them this morning after trying out the new update to <a href="http://www.feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a>.
<!-- more -->
Feedly has always integrated <a href="http://google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>, but the update includes a swipe-from-left menu letting you easily access your Reader folders. Those of you who aren&#8217;t Google Reader users can find sources in their slick new topic menu. Instapaper (and Pocket) integration, syncing read items to Reader, a dark theme, and some new font choices round out what I consider the best newsreader available on Android smartphones today.</p>

<p>Try the new Feedly people, and thank me later.</p></div>
