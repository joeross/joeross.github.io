<a href='http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-09/ru-gcc092012.php'>Gamers confront copyright law</a><div class="link_description"><p>Professor Greg Lastowka of Rutgers-Camden Law School, in a press release earlier this week about his current research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>User-generated content can make a game very valuable, but developers have a legal obligation to look out for copyright infringement. I&#8217;m interested to hear from developers how concerns about copyright infringement affect the kind of games they create.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m interested, too, and glad someone is looking into it. I look forward to reading about his findings.</p></div>
