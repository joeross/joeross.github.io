<a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2013/09/23/11-money-lessons-from-breaking-bad-modern-family-and-other-emmy-favorites/?utm_campaign=forbestwittersf&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social'>Silly Emmys pageview grab by Forbes</a><div class="link_description"><p>I&#8217;m sure Ms. McGrath is a decent reporter and human being, as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/" target="_blank">her author page</a> at Forbes.com suggests.</p>

<p>But this article about money lessons to be learned from Emmy-winning television shows doesn&#8217;t do her reputation any favors.</p>

<p>It even has a slideshow, which in 2010&#160;<a href="http://www.chadwickmatlin.com/" target="_blank">Chadwick Matlin</a>, then of the Columbia Journalism Review, now of Reuters Opinion, appropriately called <a href="http://www.cjr.org/reports/a_faustian_bargain.php?page=all" target="_blank">"the scourge, and the savior, of online journalism"</a>.</p>

<p>The Forbes post is plainly an SEO grab meant to capitalize on the wave of Emmys-related searches and entertainment articles that crested yesterday.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not against writing, shall we say, <a href="http://www.njbiz.com/section/blog-suitable-for-work" target="_blank">less hard-hitting business posts</a>, but I don&#8217;t think <a href="http://www.njbiz.com/article/20130807/SFW/130809864/How-%27Star-Trek%27-helps-evaluate-new-hires" target="_blank">referencing the Kobayashi Maru</a> did me many SEO favors. And I&#8217;m even okay with maximizing the topics that your analytics suggest play well to your audience, but there needs to be some meat on the story&#8217;s bones.</p>

<p>Slideshows are like the zombies of the digital news world: effective at spreading, but lacking in consciousness.</p>

<p>I hope for her sake a shitty editor or a misguided pageviews-at-any-cost editorial policy made Ms. McGrath do it.</p>

<p>And I hope for its own sake Forbes salvages anything left of its own reputation by eliminating such posts from its web strategy.</p></div>
