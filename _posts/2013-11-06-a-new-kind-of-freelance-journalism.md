<a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24834821'>A new kind of freelance journalism</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is essentially journalism à la carte: Peter Jukes offered to continue live-tweeting the News of the World phone-hacking trial if the crowd would fund it. Interest was strong enough to do just that, and his Indiegogo funders ordered up some trial coverage, funded through Christmas.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s probably not the first and certainly not the last, but I predict this is just the beginning of a trend and this sort of thing will be far more common in the years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong> <a href="http://chalicechick.blogspot.com/2006/04/new-kind-of-freelance-journalism.html" target="_blank">This blog</a> correctly uses the same title I gave this post to describe <a href="http://zenarchery.com/dark-miracle/" target="_blank">this long-form article</a>. So, it&#8217;s not so new, after all.</p></div>
