<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/i-got-one-but-i-dont-get-it/'>MG Siegler finally gets a Surface, despite Microsoft's best efforts</a><div class="link_description"><blockquote>
  <p>In hindsight, I now see why Microsoft did not want me to review the Surface. That was probably the right call from a PR perspective. Itâ€™s simply not a good product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Siegler found the Surface very wanting, but this bit from his intro is the most damning part of his review.</p></div>
