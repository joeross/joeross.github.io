Don't forget that you can reply to this email with feedback. For example, if you're thinking "Wow, Joe is really enlightening me with stuff I might not have found elsewhere, and for that I am eternally grateful to him forever,"  you can go right ahead and tell me that. I won't mind at all.

On an unrelated but still self-congratulatory note, those who heard about Justice Scalia's gloriously nonsensical insults (I think??) in the recent marriage equality decision may enjoy a couple of shirts I designed, because that's apparently a thing I do when I'm bored. <a href="http://teespring.com/pureapplesauce" data-cke-saved-href="http://teespring.com/pureapplesauce">Pure Applesauce</a> and <a href="http://teespring.com/jiggerypokery" data-cke-saved-href="http://teespring.com/jiggerypokery">Jiggery Pokery</a> are on sale at Teespring, but once you've seen them you've probably gotten most of the enjoyment, and they didn't cost me anything to design, so don't feel bad if you don't want to pay some money to walk around with a Scalia version of the Obama-HOPE poster on your shirt (made, I'll point out, with a public domain photo of Scalia, in case anyone was wondering).

Oh and one more thing, speaking of things I do when I'm bored: Fans of <em>The X-Files</em> may have heard there is a six-episode miniseries on the way starring David Duchovny <em>and</em> Gillian Anderson. I'm excited. So excited that I made <a href="http://countdowntoxfiles.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://countdowntoxfiles.com/">countdowntoxfiles.com</a>.

<blockquote>UCLA Health said on Friday that data on as many as 4.5 million individuals was at potentially at risk, although it added it had not yet found evidence that individuals' personal or medical information was actually accessed or acquired during the breach.</blockquote>
It's hard to imagine how we won't all be affected by a data breach at some point. I fudged some numbers, because that's what English majors do with numbers, and in the past month alone we have seen personally identifiable information about almost 30 million United States citizens accessed by hackers and therefore potentially subject to exploitation or publication.

The population of the United States is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+usa&amp;oq=population+of+us&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.6627j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+usa&amp;oq=population+of+us&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.6627j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8">about 318 million</a>, so roughly 10 percent of us have had our private data exposed in some way by inadequate cybersecurity measures on the part of both government and private entities. Yikes. I don't care how large or small your company or department is, if you're not taking cybersecurity seriously you are being incompetent.

<blockquote>Cheerleaders for professional sports teams in California will have to be classified as employees eligible for overtime, sick days and other protections under a bill signed Wednesday by Governor Jerry Brown.</blockquote>
There has been a lot of movement in the area of womens' rights lately, but this issue hasn't gotten much attention for some reason. These women live and work according to some draconian rules as a condition of their employment and they have been treated like garbage for a long time. California, as usual, is leading the charge in bringing this under-protected group of workers some legal coverage.

<blockquote>The emergency legislation follows a New York Times expose this year about the nail salon industry that highlighted unsafe working conditions with harmful chemicals and unfair labor practices that included paying less than the legal minimum wage and withholding paychecks.</blockquote>
The story is one of the best I've seen this year in terms of reporting and social impact. Read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/nyregion/nail-salon-workers-in-nyc-face-hazardous-chemicals.html" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/nyregion/nail-salon-workers-in-nyc-face-hazardous-chemicals.html">this</a> and tell me journalism isn't still alive and well in this country. The reforms aren't a final solution, but they do bring real change and signal that state and city lawmakers are aware of the severity of the problem.

<blockquote>The opinion follows by three years a decision from the EEOC that discrimination based on gender identity is also sex discrimination. That ruling on transgender employment rights has been broadly accepted by the federal courts.</blockquote>
BuzzFeed broke this story, but Dale Carpenter of the Volokh Conspiracy got the link from me because he included a link to the <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/07/EEOC-gay-Title-VII-decision.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/07/EEOC-gay-Title-VII-decision.pdf">PDF</a> of the decision. -5 points for failure to cite to relevant authority, BuzzFeed.

Anyway, this is not a statute (although it is based on one) or a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Supreme Court decision</a>, but it does offer another layer of real protection from discrimination. And the respect shown by federal courts to the EEOC's prior ruling on gender identity is a good sign that this one won't face much opposition. The question is, when the hell is Congress going to do its job and update the 1964 Civil Rights Act to codify what should be common sense to anyone with a two-hemisphere brain.

<blockquote>This homeless man --- who totes his belongings in white plastic bags, haunts the intersection of 17th and I streets NW and sometimes sleeps at a church --- studied law alongside U.S. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and former Wisconsin senator Russ Feingold. All of them graduated from Harvard in 1979.</blockquote>
The stereotype that homeless people are all lazy or addicted is masking the true problem: a lack of mental health treatment. Research suggessts <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+illness+homeless&amp;oq=mental+illness+hom&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6825j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+illness+homeless&amp;oq=mental+illness+hom&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6825j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8">as many as one-third of homeless people</a> suffer from some form of mental illness. This story illustrates the devastation mental illness can cause to someone's life even when they're brilliant and motivated and on the right track.
