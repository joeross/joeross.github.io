<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7384871/why-were-reporting-on-sony-leak-hack-ethics-mpaa'>The ethics of reporting on the Sony hack</a><div class="link_description"><p>Emily Yoshida (<a href="https://twitter.com/emilyyoshida" target="_blank">@emilyyoshida</a>), entertainment editor at <em>The Verge</em>, one of my favorite tech news sites, on the publication&#8217;s ongoing and deep contemplation of the ethics of reporting on unethically leaked information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The contents of the leak are already public; they&#8217;re just not in a very user-friendly format until a news outlet decides to amplify a piece of it. Which means, one could argue, that the press is merely drawing lines of best fit through a dataset. It could also mean that the press is essentially finishing what the hackers started.</p>
