<blockquote>All in all, for someone who was immersed in, fascinated by, and dedicated to flight, I was disappointed by the wrinkle in history that had brought me along one generation late. I had missed all the great times and adventures in flight.</blockquote>

<p>Hardly, Mr. Armstrong, hardly.</p></div>
