<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/facebook-gender-identity/'>Facebook Opens Up LGBTQ-Friendly Gender Identity And Pronoun Options</a><div class="link_description"><p>Following up on my <a href="http://joeross.me/post/76607756096/kansas-anti-gay-segregation-bill-is-an-abomination" target="_blank">recent tirade</a>, this made me happy. Facebook has massive amounts of influence, and is influenced by massive amounts of people, and changes like this are a positive step forward in how technology reconciles with shifting norms and modes of self-identificaiton. Good on &#8216;em.</p>

<p>Now, if Mr. Zuckerberg needs a good charity write-off for tax season, I would be happy to put him in touch with my student loan creditors.</p></div>
