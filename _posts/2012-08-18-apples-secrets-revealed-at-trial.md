<blockquote>
  <p>In cross-examination, Mr. Forstall said Eddy Cue, now head of Apple&#8217;s Internet services efforts, had used a 7-inch Samsung tablet for a time, and sent an email to Chief Executive Tim Cook that he believed &#8220;there will be a 7-inch market and we should do one.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the rumor mill is <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/smartphones/20646/wsj-bloomberg-confirm-apples-785-inch-ipad-mini-plan" target="_blank">still citing anonymous sources</a>, this quote, for me, seals the deal. If Apple thinks there is a market (and at least one of its high-ranking executives does), and Apple thinks it can dominate that market (and they already dominate the ~10 inch tablet market), Apple will enter that market.</p></div>
