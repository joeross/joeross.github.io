[Ex-Googler says she exposed company-wide pay inequality with crowdsourced spreadsheet](http://fusion.net/story/168986/ex-googler-says-she-got-in-trouble-for-exposing-company-wide-pay-inequality/)

Kristen V. Brown wrote for *Fusion* about Googler Erica Joy's recent salary spreadsheet. Google had no response to her request for comment, which is the worst kind of response to something like this. Apple released, deliberately, a [dismal diversity report](http://www.apple.com/diversity/) (read: majority male, majority white) last year, and [Tim Cook took responsibility for fixing it](http://mashable.com/2015/06/08/tim-cook-apple-diversity-women-future/). 

If there is a pay disparity problem at Google, or even the illusion of a pay disparity problem, Google PR needs to be on top of this story. The only time silence is ever okay is when you're prepping a statement that will include unequivocal evidence that there is no disparity.
