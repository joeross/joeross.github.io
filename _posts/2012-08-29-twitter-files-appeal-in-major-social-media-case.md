<a href='http://gigaom.com/2012/08/27/twitter-files-appeal-in-major-social-media-case/'>Twitter files appeal in major social media case</a><div class="link_description"><p>Jeff John Roberts provides an update on Twitter&#8217;s latest legal battle over at <em>GigaOM</em>. I think it&#8217;s fascinating that Twitter is living two lives:</p>

<p>They&#8217;re vigorously defending the rights of their users to maintain control over what happens to their tweets with regard to the government. They&#8217;re also perfecting a a cold hostility toward third-party developers.</p>

<p>These two strategies feel, for obvious reasons, very different from one another. But they are both directed at achieving the same two goals:</p>

<ol><li>to maximize the user-base, particularly to keep Twitter attractive to dissidents, protesters, journalists, and others whose use cases may involve sensitive or vulnerable action or information
</li>
    <li>to maximize Twitter&#8217;s control over user-generated content (mostly individual tweets) and how it is consumed by users </li>
</ol><p>It&#8217;s a great time to be a Twitter user who is happy with the service&#8217;s in-house apps and undaunted by their increasing bloat. It is a very <em>bad</em> time to be someone interested in providing Twitter users with a better experience that Twitter itself is willing or able to do.</p></div>
