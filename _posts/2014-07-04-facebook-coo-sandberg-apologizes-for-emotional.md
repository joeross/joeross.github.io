<a href='http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/02/facebooks-sandberg-apologizes-for-news-feed-experiment/'>Facebook COO Sandberg apologizes for emotional contagion experiment</a><div class="link_description"><p>R. Jai Krishna, reporting on the reaction of Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to the outcry over the company’s <a href="http://joeross.me/post/90201443064/facebook-experimented-on-its-users-emotions" target="_blank">experiment on the emotions</a> of nearly 700,000 unwitting users:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We take privacy and security at Facebook really seriously because that is something that allows people to share” opinions and emotions, Sandberg said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The telling part about Sandberg’s reaction is that those who take privacy and security seriously don’t have to say it very often, if at all.</p></div>
