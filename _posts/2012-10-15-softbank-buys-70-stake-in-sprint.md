<a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/sprint-gets-closer-to-a-deal-with-softbank/'>SoftBank buys 70% stake in Sprint </a><div class="link_description"><p>Michael J. De La Merced and Neil Gough, in <em>The New York Times</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a statement on Monday, SoftBank, a big Japanese telecommunications company, said it would pay $8 billion to buy newly issued Sprint stock worth about $5.25 a share. It will then pay $12.1 billion to buy existing stock from other investors at $7.30 a share, a premium to current levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be a very big deal. Sprint just became a strong third place again to Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p></div>
