<a href='http://blog.zackshapiro.com/want-to-learn-to-code-start-here?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed: svbtle (Svbtle Featured)'>Want to learn to code? Start here.</a><div class="link_description"><p>Zack Shapiro offers some great advice for those interested in learning to code <em>as a means to build something</em>. I&#8217;m one of those people he mentions who are using <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> but I make it a part of my weekly routine and it&#8217;s helping.</p>

<p>I wrote a post <a href="http://constantandendless.com/post/28065837003/code-as-perspective" target="_blank">almost a year ago</a> about how code relates to the law, and I stand by it: it&#8217;s a great way of learning to think critically. Even if you don&#8217;t learn to build what you have in mind, you&#8217;ll get some useful lessons out of the experience.</p></div>
