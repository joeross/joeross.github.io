<p>Greg Sandoval, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57468798-93/netflixs-lost-year-the-inside-story-of-the-price-hike-train-wreck/" target="_blank">writing at <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of the former Netflix employees who moved to Qwikster, their old jobs had been filled. They no longer had a place at the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/in-wake-of-a-bevy-of-new-content-deals-netfli" target="_blank">once asked</a> &#8220;What is going on at Netflix?&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t alone, either. Reed Hastings definitely failed all of his customers in the price-hike/Qwikster debacle, but this good article by Greg Sandoval at <em>CNET</em> points out that Hastings screwed a bunch of perfectly good employees, too.</p>
