[Re-engaging driver with questions after saying he’s free to leave is a second stop](http://fourthamendment.com/?p=16993)

This is worth knowing if you're a Pennsylvania resident or you find yourself frequently driving through the state. *However*, do yourself a favor and don't throw it in the face of an officer whose behavior implies he or she doesn't know about this precedent. If you're innocent, keeping it to yourself will expedite the stop. If you're guilty, comply with the officer and bring up this case to your public defender or private defense attorney.
