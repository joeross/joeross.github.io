<p><em>I originally posted this to one of my old blogs, The Rotten Word, in <a href="http://www.therottenword.com/2009/04/why-i-chose-temple-law.html" target="_blank">April 2009</a>. I wanted to publish it here as well because I plan to write a follow-up soon, having graduated in January of this year. Many thanks to Philadelphia litigator Max Kennerly for his <a href="http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2009/04/articles/the-law/for-law-students/why-i-choose-temple-law-some-advice-for-an-incoming-law-student/" target="_blank">advice and kind words</a> about this post when it first ran. Also, <a href="http://phillygrrl.com/2009/06/25/if-youre-going-to-temple-law/" target="_blank">this post</a> by my Temple law classmate and friend Kishwer Vikaas Barrica was humbling, so thanks to her too!</em></p>

<h2>In the Beginning&#8230;</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not a choice easily made. First of all, just the decision to take the <a href="http://www.lsac.org/" target="_blank">LSAT</a> is a journey in itself. It requires research, asking the right questions of the right people, preparing for failure and, perhaps most importantly, preparing for success.
It&#8217;s the success that can be most confusing. After all, if you do poorly on the test the first time, you resolve that you probably didn&#8217;t take it seriously enough, or that it was just a bad day. There&#8217;s a &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; feel to it. The first time I took the LSAT, my score was <em>embarrassing</em>. The only saving grace was that the average friend and family member has never had any reason to learn the how the test is scored, so they don&#8217;t know how poorly I did.</p>

<p>I could have gotten off the train right there. I almost did. I almost decided that maybe it isn&#8217;t meant to be. But then I thought about it, and remembered that I don&#8217;t think <em>anything</em> is meant to be. That&#8217;s the great liberating foundation of my personal moral value system: freedom at the cost of accountability. Things happen to me because (a) I have made a decision that caused them or (b) someone else has made a decision that caused them. Thus, I can <em>decide</em> that I&#8217;m not cut out for lawyering, or I can decide that I am, and then act.</p>

<p>So I took it again. And I did better. <em>Much</em> better. Suffice it to say that I am no longer embarrassed, even by my first score, because my second vindicated me. I studied harder, focused more deliberately, and made executive decisions about which questions I could answer well and which ones I could not.</p>

<p>But getting a score you can respect yourself for is only the beginning.</p>

<h2>Decisions, Decisions</h2>

<p>Will you devote all of your time to your studies, subsidizing your living expenses as well as the cost of your education? Or will you retain your current employment, making the (in my opinion) far more daunting commitment to maintain your financial standing and continue to accrue work experience while you submit to the rigor of a legal education?</p>

<p>On the one hand, going to school full time looks like the most sensible decision. Everything you have heard about law school is true: it&#8217;s <em>hard</em>. It&#8217;s not an afterthought, or a hobby. It&#8217;s at <em>least</em> as mentally stressful as your job, and probably more. Like any graduate school, every hour of class time requires at least an hour outside the classroom. So, the ability to go to class all day and devote your evenings to study and work is a precious resource.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the economy is (still) bad, and even if previously borrowed loans are deferred while you are in graduate school, there are bills and rent to be paid, not to mention food and (dare I say) the occasional drink. Borrowing money for these expenditures is inadvisable at best. Working through law school is difficult, but, since the evening division is a part-time program, credit requirements are flexible: you must complete a certain amount, but you have summer sessions during which you can earn credit, as well. You can keep earning money, and producing promotable deliverables. But you&#8217;ll be spending a few hours a night, a few nights a week, in a classroom. And that&#8217;s before you even start your homework. It may be a part-time education, but it&#8217;s a second full-time job.</p>

<h2>So why did I choose Temple Law?</h2>

<p>Well, even taking into account the (generous) aid package Drexel offered me, I would have had to borrow more money to cover living expenses than I&#8217;ll likely need to borrow to go to Temple. Also, my 401(k) account makes me smile, and cutting it off for a few years would mean less smiles. Finally, I&#8217;ve got a good thing going at my current job: good work, good people, good benefits. These are not things to be taken lightly in today&#8217;s job market. For every lawyer making $80k right out of school, there are three more at the unemployment office. And we&#8217;re talking <em>partners</em> here. People with <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>I made the commitment to work and go to school at the same time. I want to be confident about it, even arrogant. But the truth is that it&#8217;s terrifying. After all, I might not be able to do it. Then what? I don&#8217;t know. But I know that it&#8217;s what I want, and people do it every day. People with more stressful jobs, people with children. There are really no excuses.</p>

<p>Classes are technically from 6pm to 10pm. I&#8217;m going to be in danger of succumbing to my burgeoning caffeine addiction. I&#8217;m going to be in danger of burning out. I&#8217;m going to be in danger of driving the girlfriend (more) insane (than usual).</p>

<p>But maybe I&#8217;ll quit caffeine and start meditating. Or running. Maybe I&#8217;ll apply my work ethic to my studies, and develop a schedule that includes class time, study time, and mental stability time. Maybe I&#8217;ll do well.</p>

<h2>Closing Argument</h2>

<p>This absurdly long post has served primarily as a &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221; session for me, in which I&#8217;ve tried to express what has been going on in my head as I near the next and most important part of my journey: actually going to law school. But this is the tip of the iceberg. This stuff takes me away mid-conversation at work, puts blank stares on my face while Meg&#8217;s talking to me, and keeps me wide awake in bed. It worries me, aggravates me, <em>scares me</em>. This is the stuff I always thought adults had to deal with, the stuff that I got to watch other people figure out while I wrote stories or played my guitar.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m one of those people. I have a job, investments, credit cards, an actual (and good) credit score. I don&#8217;t think I could afford to work a side job and go to school. So it might take me longer to finish, while I take fewer classes. But my sense of financial security is young and, with the exception of some indinspensable help (for which I&#8217;ll always be grateful), largely self-wrought. Risking it doesn&#8217;t seem right. So wish me luck.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to need it.</p>
