<a href='http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/12/great-netflix-christmas-outage-thankfully-over/60303/'>Netflix via Amazon</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is interesting: Netflix delivers its streaming option via one of Amazon&#8217;s cloud storage and content distribution networks. I try to avoid summarizing other peoples&#8217; work, but the other interesting bit here is that Amazon&#8217;s in-house streaming video service saw <em>no</em> interruption.</p>

<p>If I was a paranoid conspiracy theorist, I&#8217;d throw around phrases like &#8220;net neutrality concerns&#8221; right about now. Is Amazon prioritizing their own content over the content of competitors whose content they&#8217;re contracted to deliver?</p></div>
