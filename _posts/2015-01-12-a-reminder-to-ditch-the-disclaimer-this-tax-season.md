<blockquote>
  <p>According to the final Regs, “the rules in the final regulations are intended to eliminate the need for unnecessary disclaimers.” In other words, the IRS gave a nod to how crazy things had become, noting, “These types of disclaimers are routinely inserted in any written transmission, including writings that do not contain any tax advice.” The rules and the lack of understanding of the rules “contributed to overuse, as well as misleading use, of disclaimers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, please, <em>please</em> listen to her sage advice and get rid of those stupid disclaimers <em>unless your correspondence actually includes actionable tax advice</em>.</p>

<p>And while you&#8217;re at it, if you&#8217;re into tax law you should check out <a href="http://www.taxgirl.com/" target="_blank">her blog</a> and find her <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, as well.</p></div>
