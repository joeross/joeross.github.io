<a href='http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design'>The Honest Design Age</a><div class="link_description"><p>Allan Grinshtein of <a href="http://layervault.com/tour" target="_blank">LayerVault</a>, design software, designed for designers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be crazy to call these designers lazy — there’s an awesome amount of work and detailed involved in recreating beautiful “rich corinthian leather.” Still, it is laziness to not continue to refine. Remove the unnecessary embellishments and keep stripping until you’ve almost gone too far. We believe that elegant interfaces are ones that have the most impact with the fewest elements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a user who wishes more designers would refocus their talent away from skeumorphisms and toward the elegance Grinshtein describes above, I couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself.</p></div>
