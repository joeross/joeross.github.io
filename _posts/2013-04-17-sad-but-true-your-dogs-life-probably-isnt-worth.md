<a href='http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/04/10/4765779/no-monetary-award-for-a-texas.html'>Sad but true: your dog's life probably isn't worth anything</a><div class="link_description"><p>Okay, I admit going overboard with the headline, but it&#8217;s accurate, at least in the majority of US jurisdictions. Animals are property, and the types of animals not frequently appraised, like your standard family dog, probably won&#8217;t be considered as having any monetary value at all. That makes suing for negligent euthanasia a long shot that may only add insult to injury.</p></div>
