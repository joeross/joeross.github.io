<a href='http://mashable.com/2013/01/31/ces-best-in-show-dish/'>CBS "Streisanding" itself among courts with CNET debacle</a><div class="link_description"><p>CBS’s strong-arming of CNET on this front has the exact opposite of the intended effect: now that it is clear how much control CBS has and is willing to exert over CNET content, any reasonable court must consider the possibility that the corporation is as deliberate about what CNET is allowed to do as they are being about what CNET is not allowed to do. Stock manipulation is the one I’m really thinking about here, but perhaps there are others.</p>

<p>It’s poor management, poor lawyering, and broken logic.</p></div>
