<p>A random piece of trivia that caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>He actually built an earthquake machine in his laboratory in New York City, and when he turned it on they had to smash it with a sledgehammer to keep it from taking the whole block down. Not a useful invention, but kind of cool.</blockquote>
