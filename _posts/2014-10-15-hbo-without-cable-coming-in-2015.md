<a href='http://recode.net/2014/10/15/hbo-says-its-going-to-start-selling-on-the-web-next-year/'>HBO without cable coming in 2015</a><div class="link_description"><p>Peter Kafka reports at Recode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[HBO CEO Richard] Plepler said the company will go “beyond the wall” and launch a “stand alone, over the top” version of HBO in the US next year, and would work with “current partners,” and may work with others as well. But he wouldn’t provide any other detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plepler has been pondering this possibility for <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/post/45998955410/hbo-ceo-wants-to-bundle-hbo-go-with-your-internet" target="_blank">a while</a>, and a couple of years ago I did <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/post/28065845006/pirates-of-westeros-the-untapped-half-billion-dollar" target="_blank">some back-of-the-napkin math</a> which suggested there is a <em>lot</em> of money to be had in a web-only subscription.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not known for my math skills, but it looks like I was on to something.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Correction:</strong> This post has been updated because I originally stated the year HBO plans to launch its web-only offering as 2014 in the link at the top, instead of 2015, which is the correct year. Sorry folks.</p></div>
