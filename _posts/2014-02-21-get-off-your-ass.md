<a href='http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/19/sitting-disease-disability-older-adults/5583941/'>Get off your ass</a><div class="link_description"><p>It makes for funny headlines, like <a href="http://keypulp.com/2011/04/18/your-ass-is-deadly/" target="_blank">this one I came up with three years ago</a>, but the science just keeps coming: sitting too much damages human health.</p>
