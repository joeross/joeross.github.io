<a href='http://blog.feedly.com/2012/09/14/the-new-feedly-mobile-ios-and-android/'>Feedly's new vertical page swiping enables speedy feed scanning</a><div class="link_description"><p>The recently update to Feedly, my Google Reader-enabled feed reader of choice, is better than ever for speeding through lots of unread items. Feedly has always been able to mark all items read in Google Reader as you swipe through the app, but the vertical scrolling feels more natural and speedier than the old horizontal style. They also implemented a pull-up-to-close gesture within articles which is more intuitive than the double-tap gesture, although the latter still works as well. </p>

<p>Flipboard, Pulse, and similar apps are nice, but I always find myself returning to Google Reader and apps that focus on it. I predict that one day Google will wise up and buy Freely, perhaps merging them with the Currents and Reader projects, and hopefully replacing their functional but boring Google Reader mobile apps.</p></div>
