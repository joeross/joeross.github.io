<a href='http://blog.bufferapp.com/bad-customer-service-support'>What Bad Customer Service Costs Your Business</a><div class="link_description"><p><a href="http://bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Buffer</a>, the service that will schedule your social network posts to go live throughout the day, also happens to have a <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">wonderful blog</a>. They focus on productivity and customer service.</p>

<p>Buffer&#8217;s customer service is excellent: I emailed them asking why I <em>have</em> to select publishing times for Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other services individually instead of setting a global schedule for all services, and they replied within the hour.<sup id="fnref:p47712809653-1"><a href="p47712809653-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The infographic they posted was created by <a href="http://helpscout.net/" target="_blank">HelpScout</a>, the folks who do Buffer&#8217;s customer service, so know where to find this data.</p>

<p>The takeaway? Customer service is absolutely as important as feature development and marketing, and not enough companies know that.</p>

<p>Note that it&#8217;s not always wise to set a global publishing schedule, as each service has its own peak times-of-day for usage, but I&#8217;m only sharing a smattering of links that are interspersed with &#8220;direct&#8221; posts I manually do all day, so it&#8217;s not a concern for me. <a href="p47712809653-1" rev="footnote" target="_blank">↩</a></p>
