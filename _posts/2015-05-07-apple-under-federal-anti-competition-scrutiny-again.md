[Apple under federal anti-competition scrutiny, again](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8540935/apple-labels-spotify-streaming)

Micah Singleton writes for The Verge:

> Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTubeâ€™s music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube. Apple is seemingly trying to clear a path before its streaming service launches, which is expected to debut at WWDC in June. If Apple convinces the labels to stop licensing freemium services from Spotify and YouTube, it could take out a significant portion of business from its two largest music competitors.

I dislike hyperbole, but the fact that Apple would even engage in behavior that is capable of *misperception* as anti-competitive is shocking.
