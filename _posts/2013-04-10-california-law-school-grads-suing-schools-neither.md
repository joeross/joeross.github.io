<a href='http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-law-grads-20130402,0,1312864.story'>California law school grads suing schools; neither party has a good point</a><div class="link_description"><p>Attorney Michael C. Sullivan, representing California schools in a spate of fraud suits brought by students over shady job-placement numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"What I find most ironic is that those individuals advertised themselves to law schools as great critical thinkers," Sullivan said of the law-grads-turned-litigants. "Now they say they never considered the possibility that employment might include part-time jobs."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Sullivan&#8217;s statement is ludicrous. The <em>students</em> pay, so the <em>schools</em> market. His clients, if the allegations prove true, <em>marketed</em> themselves as producers of very employable law graduates. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that when a <em>law</em> school shares post-graduation employment rates, the <em>law</em> school is referring to <em>legal</em> employment.</p>

<p>My incredulity at Mr. Sullivan&#8217;s absurd position does not mean that I&#8217;m ignorant of the fact that many students didn&#8217;t try very hard to get a job, or didn&#8217;t like the jobs they got, or should have known the market for legal jobs is, to put it mildly, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-the-job-market-for-law-school-grads-crumbled-and-how-it-could-come-back-to-life/272852/" target="_blank">in dire straits</a>, and has been for some time now.</p>

<p>In fact, I have little sympathy for people swindled by Mr. Sullivan&#8217;s clients&#8217; number games. Just search <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=legal%20job%20market&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=efeab37813788df6&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44697112,d.dmQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=994" target="_blank">"legal job market"</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=should+i+go+to+law+school&amp;oq=should+i+go+to+&amp;gs_l=serp.3.0.0i20l2j0l2.67820.69234.0.69984.15.10.0.5.5.1.209.1110.3j6j1.10.0...0.0...1c.1.8.psy-ab.OyX-TrOxxi8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=efeab37813788df6&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=994&amp;ion=1" target="_blank">"should I go to law school?"</a>.</p>

<p>I knew when I signed up for law school in 2009 that things were not going well for recent graduates, and that they were not expected to recover before I graduated. I went anyway because I want to be an attorney. Never do something that requires years of your life and tens of thousands of dollars without doing your research.</p>

<p>Due diligence is too strong a phrase for it: it&#8217;s common sense.</p></div>
