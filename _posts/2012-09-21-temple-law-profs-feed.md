<p>I used <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo Pipes</a> to make a feed that unites all posts by Temple profs writing at their various law blogs. The feed still needs some work, specifically to ensure that the author name, and preferably the name of the blog at which they&#8217;re writing, is published in every entry. But overall I&#8217;m very happy with it.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t get permission from them or from their respective blogs, but since the stuff is posted publicly, all the content in my united feed is available freely in each separate feed, and all the entries in my united feed link directly out to the source posts, I don&#8217;t see why anyone would object.</p>

<p>But, of course, if anyone <em>does</em> object, I&#8217;ll remove them from the feed immediately. In fact, at any point in time, and without warning, I may need to delete the feed altogether, so consider yourselves warned.</p>

<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s a convenient way to follow what interests Temple Law professors on a day-to-day basis, particularly with regard to current events in their respective areas of expertise.</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/templelawprofsfeed" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the feed</a>, and <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=eb23bf4f9e4378fef8854a243106f025" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the Yahoo Pipes URL</a> so you can see how I did it.</p>
