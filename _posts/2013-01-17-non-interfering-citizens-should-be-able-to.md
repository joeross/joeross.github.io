<a href='http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/aclu-philadelphia-cops-wrongly-arrest-videotapers-18229077'>Non-interfering citizens should be able to videotape on-duty police</a><div class="link_description"><p>If someone is videotaping a police incident, but not interfering therewith, there is no lawful justification for police interference. I&#8217;m not always in agreement with the ACLU, but this harassment must end. A nation where state surveillance is only increasing must be open to the right of citizens to turn the lens in the other direction.</p></div>
