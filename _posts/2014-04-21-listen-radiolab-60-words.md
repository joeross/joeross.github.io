<a href='http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/'>Listen: Radiolab - 60 Words</a><div class="link_description"><p>From the description of the latest episode of Radiolab, this week’s featured podcast from among the 75 to which I subscribe (recently whittled down from about 85…):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the “war on terror.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BuzzFeed’s Gregory Johnsen helped Radiolab adapt <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/gregorydjohnsen/60-words-and-a-war-without-end-the-untold-story-of-the-most" target="_blank">his longform article on the subject</a> for the podcast. It’s a fascinating episode, whether you’re an international law geek or not. Follow the link or use the player below to listen to the episode.</p>
