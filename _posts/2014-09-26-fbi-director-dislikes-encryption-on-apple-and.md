<a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/apple-google-default-cell-phone-encryption-concerns-fbi-director/'>FBI Director dislikes encryption on Apple and Google devices</a><div class="link_description"><p>Encryption of data on mobile devices is a big selling point in our post-Snowden world. But FBI Director James Comes isn’t happy about it:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law.
</p></blockquote>

<p>David Kravets of Ars Technica reports Comey has “reached out” to the companies about the issue. Absent new or amended legislation, though, there is little he can do about it, precisely because there is such a sales incentive to marketing encryption these days.</p></div>
