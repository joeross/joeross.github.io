<a href='http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/08/heartbleed-bug-puts-encryption-at-risk-for-hundreds-of-thousands-of-servers'>Heartbleed: When no encryption is better than bad encryption</a><div class="link_description"><p>Alex Hern reports for The Guardian this disturbing fact about the recently disclosed OpenSSL bug, now two years old and pervasive:</p>

</blockquote>
