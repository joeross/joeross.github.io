<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t know anything about design. I&#8217;m a user, and design work on websites made for frequent article consumption should be tailored to user experience. I may come off as arrogant, ignorant, or petty. That&#8217;s not my intention. I&#8217;m being honest about my thoughts.</em></p>

<hr><p>Engadget has launched a full re-design, something we&#8217;ve seen recently with sites like <a href="http://thenextweb.com" target="_blank"><em>The Next Web</em></a> and <a href="http://readwrite.com" target="_blank"><em>Read Write</em></a>. Like those, Engadget&#8217;s new look focuses on cross-platform responsiveness, with a bias for tablets. I don&#8217;t write about every redesign I see, but Engadget was the first blog I read with dedication, so it has a special place in my geek heart.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Engadget&#8217;s previous design was, as even <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/" target="_blank">Editor-in-Chief Tim Stevens puts it</a>, &#8220;heavy.&#8221; A better description would be clunky, crufty, and stale. I&#8217;m only going to mention a few details that are very important to me, instead of describing to you a website that you can just go see for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>TYPOGRAPHY</strong></p>

<p>The new Engadget uses the free Google Web Font <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Oswald" target="_blank">Oswald</a> for headlines. It feels too narrow, but Engadget is prone to information-rich headlines, so I can understand why they chose it. Full-width article images get a headline overlay on top of the image. Opacity of the overlay increases to 1 when you hover your cursor over the headline text. I wish it went to 1 on hover over the image itself, making it easier to get that readable opaque background behind the article title.</p>

<p>The body font is Georgia (same as this blog you&#8217;re reading now). It seems almost too pedestrian for a blog of Engadget&#8217;s means, as does the Google Web Font. After all, Engadget  has a budget and a design staff. I find it hard to believe that the best they could do font-wise was a free Google font and Georgia.</p>

<p>Then again, <a href="http://theverge.com" target="_blank"><em>The Verge</em></a> uses Helvetica or Arial, and <a href="http://readwrite.com" target="_blank"><em>Read Write</em></a> uses mere &#8220;sans serif.&#8221; These blogs often cater to dedicated fan bases, so page loading speed is important: many readers click between multiple articles in one sitting.</p>

<p>I wish font was larger in articles themselves. Yes, it&#8217;s easy to increase the size of the page with a quick CMD + (or CTRL + on Windows), but I definitely consider most of the web just a little small as far as font size. People should be able to sit back and read comfortably.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me (although I&#8217;m told my reading vision is fine), but if I have to lean forward to read a website, I&#8217;m having a bad reading experience. This is why I&#8217;m a frequent <a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a> reader but I can&#8217;t remember the last time I visited the website itself.</p>

<p><strong>MENUS AND UI</strong></p>

<p>I like the topics bar at the top of the site and the placement of the search field immediately beneath it. Expand the &#8220;Topics&#8221; item on the far right of the top bar to reveal more specific categories. The spacing is touch target friendly, and I appreciate the lack of some fancy separator character.</p>

<p>I like the banner at the top of the site. I like the loading bar that shows the time-to-change from one featured story to the next. I like the persistent table of contents on longer articles, like the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/" target="_blank">redesign announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Share buttons are well-placed on both the front page and article pages. Pinterest is an interesting addition to sharing options and one that I don&#8217;t see very often on sites of Engadget&#8217;s type. I occasionally dive into Pinterest myself to pepper my friends with gadget posts. Maybe Engadget can read my mind&#8230;</p>

<p>Probably not, though, otherwise the &#8220;Via&#8221; and &#8220;Source&#8221; links would be internalized instead of placed in article footers. I don&#8217;t go to Engadget because I think they break <em>every</em> tech news story ever, I go because their opinions on the news interest me. Thus, in-line source linking wouldn&#8217;t risk losing me to the source. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m the exception or the rule, but something about placing source links in the footer has always bugged me.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like the sidebar with the headline-over-dimmed-image motif. It works in the main body of the site, but in the sidebar it&#8217;s cluttered and incredibly difficult to scan. I want to see &#8220;Recent Reviews&#8221; and other site content placed above links to the podcasts and other supplementary media. The &#8220;Quoted&#8221; section includes recent tweets from Engadget authors, but I think this space would be better used for pull-quotes from high-traffic or recent articles.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Engadget&#8217;s new design is an improvement over the old one, and they plan still more changes as they settle into the new look. Generally, I think their design direction and that of the big-name tech blogs as a whole is great. Tablet-optimized design built for fingertips instead of cursors leads to less clutter and more negative space. In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, that aesthetic tracks well with my own preferences, so it&#8217;s encouraging to me and hope it continues. I know these websites are businesses, but at the end of the day the reading experience is absolutely everything, and if things continue down this path, I expect to see even more improvements in the future.</p>
