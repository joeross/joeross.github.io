<a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23381448'>Dubai: Where rape is only a crime if you're the victim</a><div class="link_description"><p><strong>Update: <a href="http://joeross.me/post/56141034096/norwegian-rape-victim-marte-deborah-dalelv-pardoned" target="_blank">she has been &#8220;pardoned.&#8221;</a></strong></p>

<p>A Norwegian woman was raped, reported it to police, and was charged and convicted of extramarital sex, drinking alcohol, and perjury. She was sentenced to 16 months in jail.</p>

<p>For being raped.</p>

<p>And that’s three months longer than her attacker.</p>

<p>This is a major problem of international law. What happens when the economic and business relationship between two states places citizens in the crosshairs of antiquated and ignorant laws? What is the remedy when the Western expectations of a visitor are shattered by foreign norms that, well, prompt Western folks to use words like “antiquated&#8221; and “ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Norwegian government has the woman safely housed in what sounds like a naval base, but there is a warrant out for her arrest.</p>

<p>We will find out. I’ll be keeping an eye on this story.</p></div>
