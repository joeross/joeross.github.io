<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/08/twitter-responds-about-implementing-two-factor-authentication-for-more-security-in-the-future/'>Twitter and Two-Factor Authentication</a><div class="link_description"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication" target="_blank">Two-factor authentication</a> is a pain in the ass. Just ask my Google account or my Dropbox account. But it&#8217;s a no-brainer. Savvy users will flock to it, seeing the value in the headache. Less-than-savvy users don&#8217;t need to be forced into it, but Twitter is as good a platform as any to explain to folks why it&#8217;s worth the additional steps to log in sometimes.</p></div>
