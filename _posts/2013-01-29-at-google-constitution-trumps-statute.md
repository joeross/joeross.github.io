<a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/google-says-get-a-warrant/'>At Google, Constitution trumps statute</a><div class="link_description"><p>David Kravets quotes a Googler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Google requires an ECPA search warrant for contents of Gmail and other services based on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which prevents unreasonable search and seizure,” Chris Gaither, a Google spokesman, said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119" target="_blank">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> isn&#8217;t always as demanding as Google, and their assertion that the policy is based on Constitutional requirements implies that the ECPA does not comport with the same requirements. That&#8217;s a bold legal position to take, but as Mr. Kravets explains at <em>Wired</em>, Google isn&#8217;t necessarily alone.</p></div>
