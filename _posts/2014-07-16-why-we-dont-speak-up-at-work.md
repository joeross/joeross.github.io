<a href='http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3760-why-we-dont-speak-up-at-work'>Why we don't speak up at work</a><div class="link_description"><p>This piece by Claire Lew at Signal v. Noise doesn&#8217;t exactly fit into my general topics of law, technology and design, but it&#8217;s so important I that feel obligated to share it. I mention in my <a href="http://joeross.me/post/90549983215/perverting-the-metric-the-role-of-metrics-in-editorial" target="_blank">article about the role of metrics in editorial strategy</a> that I&#8217;ve been present for some poor decisions and didn&#8217;t speak my mind.</p>

<p>Claire&#8217;s post explains exactly why I failed to speak up, and it&#8217;s an important read whether you&#8217;re a manager or not. Unlike more navel-gazing, hand-wavy articles in the management advice realm, she actually offers some practical advice.</p></div>
