<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/2/4582276/google-reader-rss-replacements-feedly-digg-newsblur'>How the death of Google Reader is saving RSS</a><div class="link_description"><p>Ben Popper, at <em>The Verge</em><sup id="fnref:p57261773210-1"><a href="p57261773210-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some Reader partisans may have given up on RSS after the shutdown, but the majority seem to have migrated to other platforms. In the weeks following the announcement, Feedly saw 3 million Google Reader refugees sign up and Newsblur says it now has 25 times the paid subscriptions it did in March.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting. It looks like Google inadvertently revived the very market Reader killed when it debuted.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still relying on Feedly right now, and they&#8217;re the paid option I&#8217;m most likely to go with whenever they begin offering a premium tier, but the options are admittedly plentiful.</p>

<p>And there&#8217;s no denying that the death of Reader, in retrospect, was probably the best thing to happen to RSS since, well, the birth of RSS.</p>

<p>I like my headline (above the quote) better than Mr. Popper&#8217;s, which is &#8220;A month after Google killed its beloved Reader, the market for paid RSS tools is booming.&#8221; His is more informative, but for some reason mine just <em>feels</em> better. Arrogance? <a href="p57261773210-1" rev="footnote" target="_blank">↩</a></p>
