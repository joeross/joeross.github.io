<a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/all/'>DARPA and deep learning</a><div class="link_description"><p>This article by Daniela Hernandez at <em>Wired</em> is well-done and fascinating. However, this bit most caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Half of the $100 million in federal funding allotted to this program will come from Darpa — more than the amount coming from the National Institutes of Health — and the Defense Department’s research arm hopes the project will “inspire new information processing architectures or new computing approaches.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make no mistake: the US military wants intelligent killing machines.</p></div>
