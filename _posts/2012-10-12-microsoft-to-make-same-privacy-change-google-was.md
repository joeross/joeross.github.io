<a href='http://marketingland.com/microsoft-privacy-change-google-attacked-23598'>Microsoft To Make Same Privacy Change Google Was Attacked For; No One Seems To Care</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is a good piece by Danny Sullivan of <em>Marketing Land</em> about the lack of coverage Microsoft&#8217;s privacy policy consolidation got this week compared to what Google got on a similar move earlier this year.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan&#8217;s analysis is thorough and worth a look, but I noticed a broader issue here for Microsoft:</p>

<p>Google matters and Microsoft doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll elaborate. Google got hammered by voluminous coverage because, in the minds of the tech press and many consumers, what they do with data <em>matters</em>. Microsoft, on the other hand, is not seen as an important player in the consumer data space. That perception may be inaccurate, particularly with the generally positive reaction to, if not widespread adoption of, <a href="http://www.skydrive.com/" target="_blank">SkyDrive</a> and the new <a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank">Outlook</a>.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s there: when it comes to privacy, Google is search and email and Android. Microsoft is, well, not much. Windows 8 and Surface may change that, but no one is holding their breath. In short, this looks like a case in which Microsoft got let less critical press coverage than they may have wanted: people complain about the things that are important to them. The unimportant things get ignored.</p></div>
