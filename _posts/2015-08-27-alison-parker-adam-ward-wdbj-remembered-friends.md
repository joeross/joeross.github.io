It's inappropriate to use these tragic murders as fodder for the never-ending Second Amendment debate, and people on both sides of the isle are already guilty of that.

If the killer's intent was to terrorize, are those people who are disseminating photographic and video imagery of the murders aiding and abetting that son of a bitch, even after his suicide?

I'm obviously emotional over this thing, as many people are, and the aiding and abetting thing is more a thought experiment than a serious question. But if we don't at least think about it, try to push the debate forward somehow, if nothing changes at all, Alison and Adam died for nothing. That's unacceptable.
