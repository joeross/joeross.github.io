[Subscribe to my weekly newsletter](http://joeross.me/newsletter/)

I don't write here as often as I'd like to, and while I've tried to alter my habits to incorporate more frequent posting it just hasn't happened, at least not yet. But a weekly newsletter may be the sweet spot as far as time management and commitment, so I'm going to try it. 

I hope you'll subscribe below and, after the sign-up confirmation, you'll get no more than one email a week, some time on Fridays, with no more than five links and some brief quotes or commentary.
