<p>There are two reasons I can&#8217;t help but be cynical about <a href="http://www.so.cl/" target="_blank">So.cl</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s latest social search experiment. I have no &#8220;official&#8221; user experience training, but both of my reasons might be considered UX critiques:</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>First, Facebook login suggests an interest in reducing friction, but my experience was anything but smooth. The So.cl page offers to let you <em>sign in</em>, so I tried to sign in with my personal email address but was told that address wasn&#8217;t connected to a registered Windows Live account. So I tried to register the same email address with Windows Live. Then, I was told it was already connected to a Windows Live account. I registered a different email address as a new Windows Live account and then got a landing page saying they&#8217;d send me an invitation ASAP. So much for signing in.</p>

<p>Facebook has its claws in  Microsoft&#8217;s little social experiment, and it&#8217;s probably <em>profoundly</em> easier to use than Microsoft&#8217;s own sign-up/in process. Unfortunately, anyone who doesn&#8217;t have a Facebook account must brave Microsoft&#8217;s abysmal Windows Live process. No third way. This is a classic case of fail, and Danny Sullivan&#8217;s experience, which he wrote about at his <a href="http://marketingland.com/microsoft-launches-so-cl-social-network-a-quick-look-12499" target="_blank"><em>Marketing Land</em></a> website, suggests the problems I had trying to get into the damn thing only continue as you dig deeper.</p>

<p>Second, Microsoft did stuff it didn&#8217;t need to waste time doing: creating a stand-alone site and allowing users to: make &#8220;rich&#8221; posts (read: blog), &#8220;riff&#8221; on other posts (read: reblog, a la Tumblr), and conduct &#8220;video parties&#8221; (read: Google Hangouts, but with less features).</p>

<p>As usual, I have some unsolicited advice for a massive technology corporation:</p>

<p>First, let users sign up with an email address. If you want to make that email address automatically a new Windows Live account, fine, but don&#8217;t ask for ZIP code and gender while you do it. Don&#8217;t use multiple redirects to sign-up stages, either. Make it <em>simple</em>.</p>

<p>Second, just integrate the experiment into <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank">Bing.com</a> itself, which looks better every time I visit it. Show users a very prominent one-time explanation and allow interested folks to opt into the experiment. Then, make the So.cl bits a minimal but eye-catching and <em>useful</em> sub-component of each search result or something. <em>Anything</em> but a distinct site. If it feels like a new feature, it&#8217;s not as off-putting as a stand-alone site, which can feel like a new hungry content monster users are expected to feed.</p>

<p>Microsoft has impressed many people with their design direction on Bing, as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone (aside from the unfortunate fact that we&#8217;re still calling the last two things &#8220;Windows&#8221; at all). Simple user experience stuff like this though shows they still have much room for improvement.</p>

<p>For the record, one of my favorite user experience designs is <a href="http://www.ifttt.com/" target="_blank">ifttt</a>. Show us what you can help us do <em>and how to do it</em> in the same step. That, to me, is an epic UX win.</p>
