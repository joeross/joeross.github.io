<a href='http://whyy.org/cms/radiotimes/2014/02/03/prospects-for-immigration-reform-in-2014/'>Temple Law Professor Peter Spirio discusses immigration reform on WHYY</a><div class="link_description"><p>I took and very much enjoyed Professor Spiro&#8217;s immigration law class at Temple Law. His firm grasp on the material allows him to speak about complex immigration issues with insights anyone can appreciate. It&#8217;s definitely worth a listen.</p>

<p>So much so, in fact, that I&#8217;m breaking with my text-only tradition here at <em>Constant &amp; Endless</em> to embed the sound file below. If it doesn&#8217;t work in this page, just click the link at the top of this post for the WHYY page.</p>

<p>Read more about Professor Spiro at the <a href="http://www.law.temple.edu/pages/faculty/n_faculty_spiro_main.aspx" target="_blank">Temple Law website</a>.</p>
