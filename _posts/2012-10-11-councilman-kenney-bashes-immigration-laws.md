<blockquote>
  <p>After 9/11, everyone became a ‘terrorist’—including that Mexican guy on a bike going from his lawn care job to his restaurant job. He is no threat to me, whatsoever. He is no threat to this country, whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kenney doesn&#8217;t like the immigration policy pushed by some &#8220;lunatics in Harrisburg&#8221; and wishes they would &#8220;exempt the city of Philadelphia&#8221; when they pass harsh immigration measures. Further, he stated that if he were mayor he wouldn&#8217;t cooperate with <a href="http://www.ice.gov/" target="_blank">Immigration and  Customs Enforcement</a> (presumably beyond what the law requires).</p>

<p>I think there are more eloquent and nuanced ways to make the argument against strong immigration restrictions and criminalizing undocumented immigrants, but I respect the hell out of Kenney&#8217;s verve for the issue, which he said reminds him of problems his Irish ancestors faced in the earlier days of our nation.</p></div>
