<blockquote>
  <p>This morning I was at the gym listening to the Django Unchained Soundtrack on my phone in the SoundCloud android app. I decided I wanted to make Trinity my song of the day on Tumblr. I hit the share icon, up came a list of apps, I selected Tumblr, and I was taken to the Tumblr app but as a link share. I wanted an audio share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens whenever I try to share something to Tumblr and it drives me crazy. Hopefully Mr. Wilson&#8217;s emails to SoundCloud and Tumblr will prompt resolution between their apps, and spur conversation about fixing this kind of thing overall.</p></div>
