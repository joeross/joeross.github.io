<a href='http://www.webosnation.com/webos-gbu-become-quasi-independent-company-focused-user-experience-and-cloud-meet-gram'>HP’s webOS group spun out into new company: GRAM</a><div class="link_description"><p>Derek Kessler of webOS Nation wrote this up yesterday. His post included an internal email to employees of the new company, “GRAM.”</p>

<p>It was very evasive, vague, and noncomittal for a internal email, but this part bothered me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be the culture. Spread our Values:  People Matter. Integrity and Trust. Deliberate Innovation. Act small, deliver big.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a series of bad PR poster captions strung together with no meaningful intent by HP’s Martin Risau. I hope its aimless encouragements aren’t illustrative of the kind of focus, or lack thereof, the new company will have.</p>

<p>webOS has deserved better than what HP has done for it from the moment their acquisition of the unique mobile OS was finalized. Hopefully, GRAM is a new, bolder, and better beginning for webOS.</p></div>
