<a href='http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/04/phila-city-council-deliberates-life-partners-reform'>Philadelphia councilman introduces bill aimed at improving health insurance prospects for life partners and transgendered people</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is an encouraging development. The bill introduced by Councilmen James Kenney and W. Wilson Goode would establish a:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6 percent tax credit for businesses that did not previously provide health care to transgendered employees or life partners[. This] is a key aspect of this bill and would be the first credit of its kind in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ordinance would also require gender-neutral restrooms in city building and protect the right to dress as appropriate to one&#8217;s self-identified gender.</p>

<p>While the article also quotes law professor Kermit Roosevelt&#8217;s sense that the law may not survive if challenged in state court, it&#8217;s heartening to see my home city championing legislation to improve the resources available to LGBT employees. Even more heartening is the focus on transgender rights, which are often lost in the much louder debates about homosexuality.</p></div>
