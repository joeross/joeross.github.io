<a href='http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/24/myspace-teases-completely-rethought-service-believe-not-looks-beautiful/'>MySpace renovations</a><div class="link_description"><p>Dear MySpace:</p>

<p>I am happy to see you lean away from Facebook and toward the new Digg and Rdio, with a clean design that prizes whitespace as much as content. Give me something functional and pretty, without the spammy taste of Facebook or the learning curve of Google+. Do this for me, and I will proselytize for you, even in the face of hopelessness.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Joe</p></div>
