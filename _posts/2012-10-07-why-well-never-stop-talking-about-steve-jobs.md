<a href='http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/10/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-steve-jobs/'>Why We'll Never Stop Talking About Steve Jobs</a><div class="link_description"><p>Mat Honan, writing at <em>Wired</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jobs, like the titans of industry before him, realized that when we think about how the world works, we are actually thinking about the way people have made it to work. And that means that if you donâ€™t like the way the world works, you are free to change it. Which is exactly what he did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honan&#8217;s was my favorite &#8220;one year since Steve Jobs died&#8221; post. It is, in many ways, the most insightful. It&#8217;s also, most importantly, the most respectful.</p></div>
