<a href='http://www.law.com/corporatecounsel/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1202612078909'>NLRB: Overbroad social media policies may violate NLRA</a><div class="link_description"><p>Sue Reisinger, writing at <em>Corporate Counsel</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a warning to employers, the National Labor Relations Board has “unliked” certain social media policies that restrict an employee’s right to speak critically of the employer online, unless the policies were set in collective bargaining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s clear many companies didn&#8217;t consider the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) implications when they developed their social media policies. It&#8217;s often HR professionals that have to draft these policies, but the onus can&#8217;t be placed solely on them to catch how the new rules might implicate nuances of the NLRA. Any company who has implemented or plans to implement a social media policy is well-advised to have a labor and employment attorney review it first.</p></div>
