<a href='http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/29/twitter-user-arrested-for-threatening-to-rape-and-murder-female-activist/'>  Twitter user arrested for threatening to rape and murder female activist</a><div class="link_description"><p>I wrote recently about <a href="http://joeross.me/post/56659362499/twitter-uk-chief-responds-to-abuse-concerns-after" target="_blank">my disappointment</a> with Twitter&#8217;s response to a woman deluged with rape threats. Today, David Edwards of t <em>The Raw Story</em> reports that a man has been arrested in England for threats made against Caroline Criado-Perez.</p>

<p>Twitter said in <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1121399/arrest-made-after-twitter-rape-threats" target="_blank">a statement to <em>Sky News</em> </a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[the] ability to report individual tweets for abuse is currently available on Twitter for iPhone and we plan to bring this functionality to other platforms, including Android and the web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good idea, let&#8217;s make that a priority.</p></div>
