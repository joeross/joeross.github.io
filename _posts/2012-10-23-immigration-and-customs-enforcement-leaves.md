<a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/us-blackberry-iphone-idUSBRE89L0YW20121022'>Immigration and Customs Enforcement leaves BlackBerry for iPhone</a><div class="link_description"><p>That&#8217;s 17,600 iPhones, purchased because, as ICE put it, RIM can&#8217;t meet the &#8220;mobile technology needs of the agency.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>As an aside, <em>Reuters</em>' Nicola Leske had a good story and reported it well enough, but the analyst quote at the end of the article is an unnecessary statement of the obvious. If it is meant to add credibility to the reporting, it fails: reliance on analysts is ever the bane of excellent journalism.</p></div>
