<a href='http://www.fastcodesign.com/3036091/the-next-big-thing-in-responsive-design'>Designing around a high bounce rate at news sites</a><div class="link_description"><p>Bounce rate is the measure of what percentage of visitors to a website only view one page before leaving the site. It’s a number you want to keep low. One way to do that is to present visitors with options for further reading relevant to the interests that brought them to your site in the first place.</p>

<p>Dan Gardner and Mike Treff of design firm <a href="http://www.codeandtheory.com" target="_blank">Code and Theory</a> addressed that challenge in a recent article at <em>Fast Company</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  To address this, most publishing sites throw in a comments section or put a static, poorly designed “recommended content” module at the bottom of the page. What they should be doing is reusing more dynamic designs and responding to users to create an ideal path for them to follow.
</p></blockquote>

<p>That “poorly designed” module is exactly what I did, manually, when I worked on the digital side of a business journal. The developer on staff at the parent company is talented and a hard worker, but he simply had too many greater priorities to drop everything and build the dynamic recommended-reading module I suggested.</p>

<p>I was in good company in making that recommendation, though. Gardner and Treff continue:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  When we redesigned the Los Angeles Times, we collaborated with the Times on an algorithm that automatically decides the best thing to serve each user, based on all the information we know about them. Crucially, the system still allows editors to override those choices when they need to respond to major events.
</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s the ideal solution for redirecting would-be one-article visitors to more stuff they’re likely to enjoy reading: automation and dynamism without a loss of editorial control. I’d also recommend a prominent opt-in because such a tool will either need to make creative use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">cookies</a> or have readers create a profile on the site as a way to mark topics they like.</p>

<p>Go read <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3036091/the-next-big-thing-in-responsive-design" target="_blank">the rest of the article</a>, it’s well worth your time whether you’re a front-end web designer, a digital editor or just an avid reader of news online.</p></div>
