<a href='http://bettermess.com/mitigating-my-mitigating/'>Mitigating My Mitigating</a><div class="link_description"><p>This post by Michael Schechter at his site <em>A Better Mess</em> hit home for me because I recently migrated this site permanently to Tumblr from a self-hosted Wordpress installation as part of a larger effort to consolidate the things I do in life and on the web. I&#8217;m also looking for a way to squeeze some exercise into what amounts to a 12-hour &#8220;work&#8221; day between my day job and evening classes. I am like Mr. Schechter in that I start lots of little projects, often with little or no eye toward whether they will still interest me in the long-term.</p>

<p>Sometimes they do. For example, I made <a href="http://joeross.me/memeframes" target="_blank">Memeframes</a> as a way to quick-glance <em>Techmeme</em> and its sister sites and I use that daily. But <em><a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Fiction By Joe Ross</a></em>, a Tumblr vehicle for my original sci-fi, hasn&#8217;t seen an update since July&#8212;and not for lack of material. It just isn&#8217;t in my weekly workflow.</p>

<p>Anyway, give Schechter&#8217;s post a read if you ever find yourself struggling with a similar problem.</p></div>
