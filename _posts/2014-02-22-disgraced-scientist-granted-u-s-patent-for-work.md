<a href='http://feedly.com/k/1nTB32n'>Disgraced Scientist Granted U.S. Patent for Work Found to be Fraudulent</a><div class="link_description"><p>It’s hard to believe this patent should ever have been approved by a patent examiner acting in good faith, especially considering the criminal convictions standing in stark contradiction of the purported “inventor’s” affidavit of lies, but let’s assume the USPTO did, as they claim, handle this one by the book.</p>

<p>Even the appearance of such ridiculous impropriety as granting a patent for fake research is enough to signal the extent to which the system is flawed.</p></div>
