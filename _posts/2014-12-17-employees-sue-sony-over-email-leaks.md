<blockquote>
  <p>Hackers began releasing sensitive data after the studio&#8217;s security breach became public on Nov. 24. The group, calling itself Guardians of Peace, has released data including thousands of pages of emails from studio chiefs, salaries of top executives, and Social Security numbers of 47,000 current and former employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many are warning of the intellectual property fallout of hacks like this. And that could, indeed, lose companies much potential revenue. But the more serious liability here is failure to secure employee information. I anticipate we&#8217;ll see many similar class actions unless companies get serious about security.</p></div>
