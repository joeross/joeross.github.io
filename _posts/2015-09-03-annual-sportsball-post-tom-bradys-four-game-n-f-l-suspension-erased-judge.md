[Tom Brady’s Four-Game N.F.L. Suspension Erased by Judge](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/sports/football/tom-brady-suspension-deflategate.html)

Tom Brady is now set to play in the Patriots' opener. I don't care, but I know my parents, my siblings and most of my friends might. Here's what the presiding judge said:

> "The court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and noncooperation with the ensuing investigation" Berman wrote. 

So there you have it. A sportsball post. Don't say I never gave you anything.
