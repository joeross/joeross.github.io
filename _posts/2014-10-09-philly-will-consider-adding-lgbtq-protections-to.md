<a href='http://phillynow.com/2014/09/29/philly-taking-the-lead-over-harrisburg-on-hate-crimes'>Philly will consider adding LGBTQ protections to hate crimes ordinance</a><div class="link_description"><p>Randy Lobasso, writing at <em>Philly Weekly</em>‘s PhillyNow blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Last week, Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown introduced a proposal along with Councilman Jim Kenney to add disability, sexual orientation and gender identity to the city’s ordinance. The proposal would add up to 90 days of jail time and a $2,000 fine if someone is convicted of hate crimes in addition to whatever other specific crime they’ve committed. It’s not much — but it’s something.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lobasso’s piece is a great primer on the politics of bill passage, and he explains eloquently and with just the right amount of indignation why Pennsylvania has so far failed to address hate crimes, housing and other venues of discrimination with respect to the Commonwealth’s LGBTQ citizens.
