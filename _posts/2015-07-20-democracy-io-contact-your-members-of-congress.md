[Democracy.io - Contact your Members of Congress](https://democracy.io/)

Great stuff from the Electronic Frontier Foundation:

> Failure to effectively reach members of Congress has disastrous consequences. Studies show that politicians fundamentally misconceive their constituents’ views, making it harder for them to represent us in the lawmaking process.

> That’s why we built Democracy.io: a new tool to put you in touch with your members of Congress—with as few clicks as possible.
