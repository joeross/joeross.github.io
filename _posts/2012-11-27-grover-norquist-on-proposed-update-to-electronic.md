<a href='http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/269303-electronic-privacy-deserves-a-bipartisan-upgrade'>Grover Norquist on proposed update to Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a><div class="link_description"><p>Twenty-plus years is a long time, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act is overdue for an update. A summary of the state of things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately these digital documents lack long-held privacy safeguards. Email saved in web-based email systems like Yahoo for longer than six months can be accessed with an administrative subpoena, which provides less protection than a warrant. Similarly, no matter what privacy setting you use, sensitive and personal information — photos, private journals, Facebook pages, corporate data, draft reports — shared with third parties like Google and Facebook can be accessible by police without a judge’s approval. All the government has to do is swear it’s &#8220;relevant&#8221; to an investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s to ensuring that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">Fourth Amendment</a> isn&#8217;t rendered moot by technological advancements.</p></div>
