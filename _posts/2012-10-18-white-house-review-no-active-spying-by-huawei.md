<a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-huawei-spying-idUSBRE89G1Q920121017'>White House review: no active spying by Huawei</a><div class="link_description"><p>Joseph Menn, quoting an anonymous source for <em>Reuters</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We knew certain parts of government really wanted&#8221; evidence of active spying, said one of the people, who requested anonymity. &#8220;We would have found it if it were there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about this specific issue and the problem of cyberwarfare threats generally. My time in International Law this semester and previous courses like Cyberlaw and Cyberprivacy are coalescing in my mind into a strong area of interest, though, so I expect to follow this and similar issues closely and (hopefully) develop more substantive opinions about them over the next two months.</p></div>
