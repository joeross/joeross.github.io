[Microsoft has acquired Wunderlist](http://www.wsj.com/article_email/microsoft-buys-german-to-do-list-startup-6wunderkinder-1433177558-lMyQjAxMTA1MDA0MTIwMjEyWj)

Amir Mizroch of *The Wall Street Journal* reports that Microsoft bought Wunderlist's parent company 6Wunderkinder for between $100 and $200 million. Microsoft is on a roll, having recently acquired [Sunrise calendar](http://sunrise.am) and purchased email app Acompli and rebranded it as [Outlook for mobile](https://www.acompli.com/). All three apps are well-regarded, particularly Outlook which was [lauded by Vlad Savov at *The Verge*](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7937841/best-gmail-app-iphone-outlook) for its email, contacts, calendar and documents integration.

Wunderlist is my task manager of choice, so I'll be keeping an eye on this story. If you haven't tried it yet I highly recommend [having a look](https://wunderli.st/cXCueu). 

[1]: Lawyers, however, should think twice before using Outlook for work because it runs everything through Microsoft's servers to provide its more powerful features.
