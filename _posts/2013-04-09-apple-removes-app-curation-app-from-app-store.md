<a href='http://appgratis.com/blog/2013/04/09/appgratis-pulled-from-the-app-store-heres-the-full-story/'>Apple removes app curation app from App Store</a><div class="link_description"><p>"Yes, you can live here," Apple seems to say to developers, "but if you ever break one of our vague rules, or if we ever decide for any reason or even for no reason at all that you must go, you will be evicted. No appeal, no questions asked, no discussion."</p>

<p>I wish only the best to the folks at AppGratis, but this is the danger in building your business, and your employees&#8217; livelihoods, on something over which you have absolutely no control.</p></div>
