<a href='http://reason.com/blog/2014/04/11/sen-coburn-replace-ntis-with-google-and'>Government agency NTIS charges for docs you can get online for free, loses money doing it</a><div class="link_description"><p>Good thing a bipartisan bill aims to end that embarrassing situation.</p>

<p>The things the National Technology Information Service does which <em>don&#8217;t</em> involve charging hundreds of dollars for free stuff and bleeding money doing it will be absorbed by the Commerce Department under the proposed bill.</p>

<p>But why does Obama want to <em>add</em> $19M to the failed agency&#8217;s budget in 2015? I don&#8217;t mean to sound like a melodramatic RNC ad, but it seems like a bad idea.</p></div>
