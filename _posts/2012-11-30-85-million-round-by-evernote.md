<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/30/productivity-app-evernote-gets-another-85m-75-in-secondary-financing-led-by-londons-acg-equity-partnersm8-capital/'>$85 million round by Evernote</a><div class="link_description"><p>It&#8217;s one of my favorite services, and the first I decided to pay for on a monthly basis. I think Libin, despite his transparent business style and easy-going manner, is genius of the caliber of any CEO at a company ten times Evernote&#8217;s size. He built something awesome, gives most of it away, and amplifies the magic for a small monthly fee.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t get to 45 million users without being awesome.</p></div>
