<p>I&#8217;ve been making changes at this site for the past month, but I&#8217;ve settled on some things and I wanted to explain them to anyone who&#8217;s interested. Some of it may bore you if you&#8217;re not a blogger or a WordPress geek. So here&#8217;s a summary:</p>

<p>This new theme isn&#8217;t going anywhere, I&#8217;ll be sharing more links and posting articles more often, I&#8217;m happy you&#8217;re reading this, and I hope you keep reading this site in the future.</p>

<p>First, the site&#8217;s new name, &#8220;Constant &amp; Endless,&#8221; is from a line in a wonderful book, and you can read more about why I picked it on my <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/about/" target="_blank">About page</a>. &#8220;By Joe Ross&#8221; was really just a placeholder name &#8212;- it was factual, but also boring and meaningless.</p>

<p>The theme, <em>Twenty Eleven</em>, is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven" target="_blank">designed by WordPress</a>. I tried <em>many</em> different themes, some were starkly modern, like <a href="http://demo.blaskan.net/" target="_blank"><em>Blaskan</em></a> (link points to a theme demo), and others were incredibly lightweight, like <a href="http://mnmlist.com/" target="_blank">mnmlist</a> (link points to a great blog about, what else, minimalism).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the common typeface <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28typeface%29" target="_blank">Georgia</a> right now, and if I don&#8217;t stick with it, I&#8217;ll choose another serif. They look classy to me if done well and presented at readable sizes. And that&#8217;s another thing: I&#8217;m setting the post font-size at 18px in an attempt to make it readable without leaning forward or squinting, whether on the desktop or the mobile web. Headlines are set in Helvetica/Arial right now, and even if I change the specific typeface, headlines will remain sans-serif.</p>

<p>More broadly, I&#8217;m using a version of <em>Twenty Eleven</em> customized by a fellow named <a href="http://yjsoon.com/" target="_blank">YJ Soon</a>. His version of the theme is built to work seamlessly with his link-posts plugin, <a href="http://joeross.me/meta/welcome-to-constant-endless/%22http://yjsoon.com/dfll-plugin%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">DFLL</a>. It allows for link posts like those on John Gruber&#8217;s <em><a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a></em>, which lead directly to what you&#8217;re sharing.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://joeross.me/apple/dont-believe-the-apple-invests-in-twitter-hype-the-verge/" target="_blank">this post</a> of mine to see what I mean. Note how the headline actually links right to the page I quoted. It works that way in my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/byjoeross" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>, too, all thanks to Mr. Soon&#8217;s plugin. You can read more about the plugin and the other tools I use to maintain this site at my <a href="http://joeross.me/colophon/" target="_blank">Colophon page</a>.</p>

<p>My statistics show at least thirty people subscribed to the feed, so if you&#8217;re one of them, I hope you enjoy the new link posts, and the longer-form aritcles I plan to keep working on. If you only want articles, or only want links, I&#8217;ll soon be offering custom feeds for you. If you&#8217;re like me and you live in your email, you can subscribe that way, too. Use the form at the bottom of the site to sign up for a daily email containing my most recent posts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t use comments here (more about that in <a href="http://joeross.me/no-comment/" target="_blank">this post</a>), but don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch via my <a href="http://constantandendless.tumblr.com/contact/" target="_blank">Contact page</a>.</p>
