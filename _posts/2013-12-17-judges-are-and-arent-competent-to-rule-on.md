<a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/16/us-usa-security-ruling-idUSBRE9BF19B20131216'>Judges are, and aren't, competent to rule on intelligence issues</a><div class="link_description"><p>Lots to parse on this one, although it looks like a new chapter in the &#8220;Surveillance Wars&#8221; Edward Snowden started with his leaks.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Two choice quotes really stood out to me in this article, though, especially because they are in sequence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of both NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency, said [&#8230;] judges &#8220;are not really in a good position to judge the merits of intelligence collection programs.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s funny, because the very next paragraph cites consistent judicial approval of the program as a defense to its continued use:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An Obama administration official said that on 35 occasions in the past, 15 separate judges assigned to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court had declared bulk communications of telephone metadata lawful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which one is it? Well, as usual with the law, it&#8217;s probably both. Judges are human too, despite what some litigators may say, and their job is to decide.</p>

<p>Whether that decision is sufficiently informed in every case is up for debate, but if the former head of the NSA and the CIA doesn&#8217;t think judges are well-equipped to render decisions on intelligence collection programs, it&#8217;s curious the Obama administration would rely on that judgment in defending the collection programs. </p>

<p>Perhaps the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) should be amended to mandate an intelligence background for all judges appointed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance panel.</p>

<p>As it stands now, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court can <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/07/09/john_roberts_scary_secret_powers/" target="_blank">quite literally appoint whomever he wants</a> to the FISA court, whether they have any experience in intelligence or not.</p>

<p>How intelligent is that?</p></div>
