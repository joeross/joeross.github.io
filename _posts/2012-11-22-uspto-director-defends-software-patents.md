<a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/11/us-patent-chief-to-software-patent-critics-give-it-a-rest-already/'>USPTO director defends software patents</a><div class="link_description"><p>Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office David Kappos, quoted by Timothy B. Lee at <em>Ars Technica</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a system like ours in which innovation is happening faster than people can keep up, it cannot be said that the patent system is broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, he&#8217;s wrong, but what else would he argue?</p>

<p>"The work my directorate does is under-funded and based upon a flawed patchwork of case and statutory law that frustrates our Constitutional mandate!"</p>

<p>Unlikely.</p></div>
