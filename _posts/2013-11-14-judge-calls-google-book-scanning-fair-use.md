<a href='http://gigaom.com/2013/11/14/google-wins-book-scanning-case-judge-finds-fair-use-cites-many-benefits/'>Judge calls Google book-scanning fair use</a><div class="link_description"><p>Great news for fair use doctrine, and a big win for word geeks.</p>

<p>Judge Denny Chin said much in his ruling granting Google&#8217;s motion for summary judgment, but this part stuck out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google Books permits humanities scholars to analyze massive amounts of data &#8212; the literary record created by a collection of tens of millions of books. Researchers can examine word frequencies, syntactic patterns, and thematic markers to consider how literary style has changed over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision is up <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/184162035/Google-Books-ruling-on-fair-use-pdf" target="_blank">on Scribd</a>. I shall geek out further about it after I have a chance to read it through.</p></div>
