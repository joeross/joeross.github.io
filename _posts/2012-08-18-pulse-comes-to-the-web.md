<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/pulse-web-launch/'>Pulse Comes To The Web</a><div class="link_description"><p>Frederic Lardinois, writing at TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The web app, says Pulse, is “designed for discovery” and while it’s still a very visual experience, Pulse did away with the row layout it uses in its mobile apps. Instead, your list of sources is now on the left and stories appear in a beautiful dynamic grid layout. The design is responsive, so the layout will automatically adapt itself to the size of your browser windows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve only tried it out for a few minutes, but it’s beautiful and functional, and it’ll be much easier to manage sources on the web than it is on mobile.</p>

<p>I cut a parenthetical in Lardinois’ headline referring to <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2012/08/09/with-internet-explorer-10-pulse-comes-to-the-web.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft’s part</a> in bringing Pulse to the web. The end result certainly does look great for touchscreen devices generally, and like it fits right into the Windows 8 design aesthetic specifically.</p></div>
