<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/07/report-for-first-time-in-decades-us-is-bleeding-high-skilled-immigrants/'>US Is Bleeding High-Skilled Immigrants</a><div class="link_description"><p>Gregory Ferenstein, writing at <em>TechCrunch</em> about Vivek Wadhwa&#8217;s latest research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nearly a quarter (24.3 percent) of engineering and technology companies had at least one foreign-born founder; in Silicon Valley, it’s nearly half (43.9 percent). Nationwide, they’ve helped employ more than half a million workers (560,000) who contributed $63 billion in sales just in 2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those numbers demand superlatives: they&#8217;re <em>staggering</em>. The common assumption is that immigrants do jobs US citizens don&#8217;t want to do. This research would seem to turn those assumptions upside-down: immigrants often do jobs for which US policy, educational institutions, and deeply-ingrained social strictures simply leave our young people unprepared.</p>

<p>My Citizenship and Immigration class meets twice weekly, on Monday and Wednesday evenings. It really is a fascinating class, and offers a broadened perspective on a hot political issue this election season.</p>

<p>One thing I&#8217;ve learned from <a href="http://www.law.temple.edu/Pages/Faculty/N_Faculty_Spiro_Main.aspx" target="_blank">Professor Peter Spiro</a> (of <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/author/peter-spiro/" target="_blank"><em>Opinio Juris</em></a> and much <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=223948" target="_blank">scholarship</a>), and from research like Mr. Wadhwa&#8217;s, is that immigration policy is not as amenable to applause-worthy one-liners as political candidates would prefer it to be.</p>

<p>The angle on Mr. Wadhwa&#8217;s recent research, and Mr. Ferenstein&#8217;s <em>TechCrunch</em> post, is that immigrant participation in US entrepreneurialism may have peaked already. I wonder, not cynically or rhetorically, but <em>genuinely wonder</em>, whether the US will be able to replace them with adequately-inspired and prepared citizens of its own, and whether the nation wouldn&#8217;t benefit from incentivizing continued and increased opportunities for citizens and immigrants alike.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what that policy direction should look like, but I think it&#8217;s worth thinking, and most importantly, talking about.</p></div>
