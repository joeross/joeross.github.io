<a href='http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/torturer-whistleblower-reporter-spy-john-kiriakou'>Some oaths are apparently more oathy than others</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is a great article, but this bit is particularly rich. Tyler Bass of Vice’s Motherboard reports the now well-known Petraeus affair with an elegant juxtaposition of facts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oaths do matter,” David H. Petraeus, then C.I.A. director, said at the time. “And there are indeed consequences for those who believe they are above the laws that protect our fellow officers and enable American intelligence agencies to operate with the requisite degree of secrecy.”</p>
  
  <p>Just weeks later, Petraeus would fall from grace after FBI agents, conducting a separate investigation, discovered emails that revealed an extramarital affair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oaths indeed.</p></div>
