<p>I like to write with a monospace font for two reasons. First, there&#8217;s nostalgia in using a monospace font that connects me to the days I spent in college writing on a typewriter. Second, I find them easier to look at for long periods of time than standard serif or sans serif fonts. </p>

<p>If you write often on a computer, you owe it to yourself to be a little picky about the fonts you use.</p></div>
