<a href='http://bettermess.com/the-plain-text-problem/'>The Plain Text Problem</a><div class="link_description"><p>Michael Schechter, writing at his blog <em>A Better Mess</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They want to take their backlog of DOC, DOCX and RTF files and convert them into either Markdown files or plain text files with Markdown formatting. At the moment, there’s no solution that’s viable for average computer users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I write my articles for this site in Markdown syntax because it&#8217;s easier to read and write. I can work with scripts and other geeky implementations when I have enough time to research how they work, but I rarely have that time. I would love a tool like the one Schechter calls for in the linked post. I hope someone takes him on the suggestion.</p></div>
