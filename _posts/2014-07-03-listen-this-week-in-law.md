<a href='http://twit.tv/twil'>Listen: This Week in Law</a><div class="link_description"><p>When it comes to my own website, editorial calendars always give way to real life. I&#8217;m back with the latest in a series that would be more accurately called the &#8220;Podcast of the Month.&#8221; I really need to step it up with these, as I still have about 70 of them to which I listen with some regularity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m featuring This Week In Law, a podcast covering technology, privacy, intellectual property and other areas of the law relevant to the internet and its users, for a couple of reasons. The first is that the most recent episode (embedded below), entitled <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law/265" target="_blank">Monkeys, Ducks and Unicorns</a>, discusses the Aereo case as well as a recent Fourth Amendment case about cell phones, both decided by the Supreme Court in June.</p>

<p>The second reason I&#8217;m featuring This Week in Law is because I have probably listened to more hours of this podcast than any other. It got me through law school by educating, entertaining and inspiring me, even while I was studying far less interesting areas of the law. The voices of Denise Howell and Evan Brown, in a way that only happens on the internet, more familiar to me than some of my longest friends&#8217; voices.</p>
