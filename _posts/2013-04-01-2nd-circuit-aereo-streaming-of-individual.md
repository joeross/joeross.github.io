<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/1/4170312/aereo-wins-major-court-battle-against-tv-networks'>2nd Circuit: Aereo streaming of individual over-the-air TV feeds via internet doesn't violate copyright law</a><div class="link_description"><p>The Second Circuit has held in <em>WNET v Aereo</em> (<a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/2a55b1d7-8f1b-46df-9a0d-82d36c31ed06/1/doc/12-2786_12-2807_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/2a55b1d7-8f1b-46df-9a0d-82d36c31ed06/1/hilite/" target="_blank">PDF</a>) that sending a unique stream of over-the-air TV signal to customers via the internet isn&#8217;t a copyright violation.</p>

<p>Aereo assign each of its subscribers their own personal antenna and stream to comply with a previous Second Circuit decision. In other words, Aereo could provide its service with one antenna, but it needs to use one for every subscriber. The use of one antenna for <em>all</em> subscribers, as the Second Circuit held in its <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13763893657469687275&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">2008&#160;<em>Cablevision</em> opinion</a>, would likely constitute an unlawful public performance.</p>

<p>Judge Chin says in his dissent that he isn&#8217;t pleased by this technique:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aereo&#8217;s &#8220;technology platform&#8221; is, however, a sham. The system employs thousands of individual dime-sized antennas, but there is no technologically sound reason to use a multitude of tiny individual antennas rather than one central antenna; indeed, the system is a Rube Goldberg-like contrivance, over-engineered in an attempt to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act and to take advantage of a perceived loophole in the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aereo&#8217;s technology isn&#8217;t an attempt to avoid the reach of the Act. It&#8217;s an attempt to comply with the Second Circuit&#8217;s own characterization of the Act&#8217;s meaning and purpose. The absurdity of the situation arises not from Aereo&#8217;s attempt at a &#8220;sham,&#8221; but from the outdated Copyright Act itself.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the rest of Judge Chen&#8217;s dissent suggests he may make some reasonable points distinguishing Aereo from the DVR service at issue in <em>Cablevision</em>, so I&#8217;ll withhold my own final thoughts on this case until I&#8217;ve read the Aereo opinion through.</p>

<p>But copyright law needs fixing. It was written during a time when the cost of copying was non-trivial, and copies were typically finite and controlled centrally by the rightsholder. There is no longer any non-trivial cost to copying. Whether between servers or from a server to your computer, the internet is nothing more or less than a giant copy-making machine. This doesn&#8217;t mean we need to weaken copyright law (although shorter terms would be more in line with copyright&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause" target="_blank">Constitutional imperative</a>), but we do need to adapt it to the modern world.</p>
