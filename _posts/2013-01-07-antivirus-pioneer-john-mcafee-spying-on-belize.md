<a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/the-bizarre-tale-of-john-mcafee-spymaster/'>Antivirus pioneer John McAfee spying on Belize</a><div class="link_description"><p>Nate Anderson, at <em>Ars Technica</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will not be shocked to learn, dear reader, that McAfee&#8217;s massive spy operation didn&#8217;t just reveal some petty corruption or embarrassing secrets but rather the existence of a Hezbollah trafficking network that funneled 11 Lebanese men a month into America. And, of course, these were probably terrorists; one man had plans to make deadly ricin from plants being grown in a Nicaraguan training camp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would have linked directly to <a href="http://www.whoismcafee.com/a-clear-and-present-danger/" target="_blank">McAfee&#8217;s post</a> in my headline, but as of this post&#8217;s publication the page throws an error that reads &#8220;Error 320 - Reverse BrowserSpy Java redirect - Session Username_: Session interrupt: invalid table.&#8221; Is he <em>really</em> logging our keys? <em>Is he?</em></p>

<p>Crazy, crazy stuff.</p></div>
