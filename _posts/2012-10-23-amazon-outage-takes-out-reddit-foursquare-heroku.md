<a href='http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/10/amazon-web-services-outage-once-again-shows-reality-behind-the-cloud/'>Amazon outage takes out Reddit, Foursquare, Heroku</a><div class="link_description"><p>Lee Hutchinson, writing at <em>Ars Technica</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These kinds of outages are a jarring reminder of the true nature of &#8220;the cloud&#8221;â€”it&#8217;s still just servers in data centers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazon&#8217;s market power in ebooks leads to some <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/amazon-kindle-drm/" target="_blank">questionable behavior</a>, as well as some <a href="http://joeross.me/post/34104358111/amazons-phantom-20-vat-for-uk-ebook-sales" target="_blank">anti-competitive business practices</a>.</p>

<p>Now it is becoming increasingly clear that reliance on Amazon by some of the internet&#8217;s most popular services could be a liability. Their cloud hosting services, which, to be fair, are well known for affordability and reliability, look like an attractive single point of failure for the things we use on the internet every day.</p></div>
