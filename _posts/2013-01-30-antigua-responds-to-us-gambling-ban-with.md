<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/dispute-with-antigua-and-barbuda-threatens-us-copyrights.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0'>Antigua responds to US gambling ban with government-backed infringement plan</a><div class="link_description"><p>The Carribean nation Antigua and Barbuda and the World Trade Organization say a US ban on online gambling is costing jobs and &#8220;billions of dollars.&#8221; The WTO has approved a plan to allow infringement of US-based copyright interests to the tune of $21 million per year.</p>

<p>The recovery looks <em>de minimis</em> next to the claimed loss, but experts quoted in Annie Lowery&#8217;s <em>New York Times</em> article are probably right: this a ploy to get US artists up in arms about Congress conceding to Antigua and Barbuda on this conflict.</p>

<p>What a strange, strange story.</p></div>
