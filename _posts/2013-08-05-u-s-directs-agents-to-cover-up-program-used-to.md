<a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805'>U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans</a><div class="link_description"><p>John Shiffman and Kristina Cooke, reporting for <em>Reuters</em> Washington bureau:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to &#8220;recreate&#8221; the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant&#8217;s Constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes well beyond spying. This is, I would argue, exactly <em>why</em> people object to such domestic spying.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>The logic is that those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear. However, the &#8220;Special Operations Division&#8221; probably isn&#8217;t infallible, since, well, no one is, and that means that you may have nothing to hide, and think you have nothing to fear, and be completely wrong.</p>

<p>Innocent people may have been convicted as a result of what appear on their face to be unconstitutional, extrajudicial practices.</p>

<p>Those arguing that the price for protection from terrorists and other would-be evil doers is letting the National Security Agency have  a peak at our Gmail will have a much more difficult time making the same case for falsifying an evidence trail.</p>

<p>The defense was often held in the dark and, apparently, at least in some cases, investigators misled both the prosecution and judicial evidentiary discretion.</p>

<p>Oh, and as a cherry on top, here&#8217;s a gem from near the end of the <em>Reuters</em> story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit&#8217;s annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The monitoring of internet communications for sensitive information, it would seem, goes both ways.</p></div>
