<blockquote>
  <p>the new proposal focuses on strengthening wiretap orders issued by judges. Currently, such orders instruct recipients to provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, leaving wiggle room for companies to say they tried but could not make the technology work. Under the new proposal, providers could be ordered to comply, and judges could impose fines if they did not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concerns that this would prompt similar measures from repressive governments abroad are not overblown. If we expect foreign companies to submit to these procedures, their governments will expect US companies to do the same. I&#8217;m surprised this article doesn&#8217;t mention anything about what the Obama administration&#8217;s diplomats and international law folks think about all of this.</p></div>
