<a href='http://cir.ca/s/v9b'>Baton Rouge sheriff trying to enforce unconstitutional anti-sodomy laws</a><div class="link_description"><p>It&#8217;s been ten years since <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html" target="_blank"><em>Lawrence v Texas</em></a> saw anti-sodomy laws declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, but I suppose stupidity is eternal. At least the District Attorney is ending the absurdity by refraining from prosecution. There may yet be hope for Baton Rouge.</p></div>
