[“Super-cuts” from same-sex marriage arguments](http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/04/super-cuts-from-same-sex-marriage-arguments/)

SCOTUSBlog contributor Tejinder Singh posted 36 minutes of audio highlights from yesterday's oral argument in [Obergefell v. Hodges](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/). The case is one of several on the Court's docket this term focused on two specific constitutional questions:

1. Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?
2. Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?

I've embedded the super-cut below but if you're *really* interested in getting a first-hand sense of how the Justices feel you can find audio of the full oral argument (more than two hours, split into two files) [at Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2014/2014_14_556). I'll have more to say about the arguments after I've had the chance to listen to them in their entirety.
