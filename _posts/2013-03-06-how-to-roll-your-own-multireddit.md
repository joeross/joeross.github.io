<p>This is probably so awesome to me because only recently have I dusted off my <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a> account and started using the internet&#8217;s greatest link-sharing site in earnest.</p>

<p>Reddit is divided into &#8220;subreddits.&#8221; These are topic-based, like <a href="http://reddit.com/r/gaming" target="_blank">/r/Gaming</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/tumblr" target="_blank">/r/Tumblr</a>. It allows the growth of communities based on shared interests or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/apathy" target="_blank">disinterests</a>.</p>

<p>Now all of <em>that</em> I knew, and you probably did, too. But what I recently found out is that you can append multiple subreddits to a URL to open them in a cocktail of sorts. So, if you want to view a mashup of Reddit entries about Philadelphia, technology, and burritos, just go to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia+technology+burritos" target="_blank">/r/philadelphia+technology+burritos</a>.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, so use <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/multireddit" target="_blank">/r/Multireddit</a> to browse what your fellow redditors have posted.</p>
