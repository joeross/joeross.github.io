[How to turn YouTube audio into a podcast episode](http://huffduff-video.snarfed.org/)

I wrote almost a year ago [about Huffduffer](http://joeross.me/blog/links/huffduffer-custom-podcast-feeds/), a service that lets you add audio files to your own custom podcast feed. It's a great way to collect episodes of podcasts to which you don't otherwise want to subscribe.

*Well*, yesterday I was listening to [episode 215](http://5by5.tv/b2w/215) of Back to Work with Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann and the hosts talked about [huffduff-video](http://huffduff-video.snarfed.org/), which is a bookmarklet that processes YouTube videos to create an audio-only file and add it to your Huffduffer feed. 

You can find some examples of how well this works at [my own Huffduffer page](http://huffduffer.com/joeross). I've added several law lectures to my feed that have languished in the Watch Later playlist in my YouTube account.
