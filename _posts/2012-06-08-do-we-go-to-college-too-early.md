<p>Merlin Mann mentioned in passing on episode #69 of his <em>Back to Work</em> podcast with Dan Benjamin, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/69" target="_blank">Seven Dwarfs of Bad Emotion</a>, that he thinks we may go to college too early.</p>

<p>I think he may be onto something, although I understand it isn&#8217;t realistic for most people to simply defer college until later in their lives.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s an interesting thought experiment: if the me of today (I&#8217;m 28, but insert your own age for fun) started college tomorrow, how much better or worse would he do than the me of age ~19?</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know the answer. I&#8217;m going to <a href="http://law.temple.edu" target="_blank">law school</a> at night these days. It&#8217;s a very different experience from my undergraduate years. After all, a liberal arts university is full of classes you don&#8217;t really care about.</p>

<p>There are still classes I don&#8217;t like in law school, but the whole experience is preparing me for a specific career choice. I spent my undergraduate time focused on literary theory and writing. It&#8217;s what I love, but nobody told me that it would be so damn difficult getting any kind of job out of it, unless I wanted to become a reporter or work retail or fast food while I worked on my world-changing novel.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/05/15/code-as-perspective/" target="_blank">elsewhere on this site</a> about how my first major was computer science, but I moved into the English department when calculus, which I simply wasn&#8217;t any good at, and Java class converged. It was soul-crushing at the time, and in retrospect, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have had such a hard time finding a job if I came out with a degree and a proficiency in coding. But life is a strange beast.</p>

<p>The nature of job competition probably doesn&#8217;t allow for any upward revision of the starting age for college. It&#8217;s best to finish college as young as possible and begin to accumulate real-world job experience. But if I began undergraduate work today, I would probably get much more out of the experience. I would certainly try harder, even in classes that didn&#8217;t interest me right away.</p>

<p>And my brain feels more attuned to the types of both abstract and practical thinking needed to really learn in a classroom setting. I&#8217;m a better learner than I&#8217;ve ever been, and it&#8217;s kind of a shame that the &#8220;me&#8221; that went to college didn&#8217;t have any of the useful experience accumulated by the &#8220;me&#8221; of today.</p>

<p>Obviously, time travel is the best solution to the problem of &#8220;today me&#8221; being more ready to excel in college than &#8220;college me.&#8221; That solution would, of course, require setting aside the limitations described by quantumn physics and irreversibly altering the timeline.</p>

<p>But who wouldn&#8217;t set aside physics and the integrity of time itself to improve a previous iteration of themselves?</p>
