<a href='http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/amazons_play'>Gruber on "Amazon's Play"</a><div class="link_description"><p>John Gruber writes one of the most respected and prolific tech blogs on the web, <em>Daring Fireball</em>. Some people deride him as a blindly-worshipful Apple fanboy who delights in pointing out the failed attempts of other companies to copy Apple&#8217;s products and strategy.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t agree with those people.</p>

<p>This article by Mr. Gruber is a great example of his willingness to praise true innovation. Amazon has taken inspiration not from Apple&#8217;s hardware or software design, but from their approach to product development.</p>

<p>Place the delight of your customers first and the device and multimedia sales will follow. Put another way, Amazon, like Apple, operates on the premise that putting customer experience first <em>is the best way</em> to put corporate success first.</p>
