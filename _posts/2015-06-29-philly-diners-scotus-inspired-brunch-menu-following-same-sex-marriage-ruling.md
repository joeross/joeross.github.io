[Philly diner's SCOTUS-inspired brunch menu following same-sex marriage ruling](http://billypenn.com/2015/06/28/morning-glory-diners-scalia-is-a-douche-breakfast-special-sells-out-in-record-time/)

Oh Philadelphia, how I miss you sometimes. Danya Henninger writes at *Billy Penn*:

> Over the weekend, Sam’s Morning Glory Diner ran a pair of specials that sold out faster than any dish in the South Philly restaurant’s 17-year history. It wasn’t the ingredients that made them a hit — although they were reportedly delicious — it was their titles, which referenced the Supreme Court’s historic June 26 ruling that the right to same-sex marriage is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

I'm not going to tell you here, so go read Henninger's article. The menu items are, appropriately, glorious. And the best part? The owner of the Morning Glory, who approved the names before they went on the menu, [is a lawyer](http://www.lawyer.com/firm/mickey-moran-p-c-pa.html).
