<a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/miss-a-payment-good-luck-moving-that-car/'>Subprime auto lenders use technology to compel payment</a><div class="link_description"><p>Michael Corkery And Jessica Silver-Greenberg, reporting at the <em>New York Times</em> DealBook blog:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Ms. Bolender was three days behind on her monthly car payment. Her lender, C.A.G. Acceptance of Mesa, Ariz., remotely activated a device in her car’s dashboard that prevented her car from starting. Before she could get back on the road, she had to pay more than $389, money she did not have that morning in March.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is as stark an illustration of the intersection of law and technology as I’ve linked to in a while. While the tech can be a blunt instrument in a world of nuance (some borrowers are doing their best, others are surely not), I don’t oppose it. Assuming everyone was aware of the terms of the loan, it’s a valid contract, etc.</p>

<p>But this sentence gave me pause:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Using the GPS technology on the devices, the lenders can also track the cars’ location and movements.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, there probably isn’t anything illegal about it, assuming a valid contract. But in a world of <a href="http://ift.tt/MN2Wgy" target="_blank">automated license plate scanning</a> and associated geo-behavioral profiling, is a GPS device overkill?</p>

<p>I suppose the business model itself is unnerving. After all, if you need to use a GPS device to manage risk, maybe you shouldn’t be making the loan in the first place. Borrowers using subprime auto loans probably just can’t afford to get a car.</p>

<p>Some drivers volunteer for activity-tracking devices as a way of <a href="http://ift.tt/1efPpJW" target="_blank">qualifying for reduced car insurance premiums</a>. Such people can already afford insurance though, and allow their provider to track their behavior as an added savings.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s less the tech involved and more the word “subprime,” which to me invariably suggests a corporation taking advantage of someone who can’t actually afford what they’re getting, and will inevitably default.</p></div>
