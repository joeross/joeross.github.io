<a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/student-rfid-suspension/'>Student loses suit over school ID requirement</a><div class="link_description"><p><em>Wired</em>'s David Kravets reports that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The girl’s father, Steven, wrote the school district explaining why removing the chip wasn’t good enough, that the daughter should be free from displaying the card altogether. “‘We must obey the word of God,” the father said, according to court documents. “By asking my daughter and our family to participate and fall in line like the rest of them is asking us to disobey our Lord and Savior.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, in the modern American climate of violence, it&#8217;s hard to support someone who refuses to wear an ID, especially with the the tracking removed by the school. You can download the 25-page ruling as a PDF document <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/files_images/general/01-08-2013_Hernandez_Ruling.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>
