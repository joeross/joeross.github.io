<a href='http://blogs.phillymag.com/the_philly_post/2012/08/16/radical-plan-save-philadelphia-newspapers/'>How to Save the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News</a><div class="link_description"><p>Joel Mathis, writing at <em>Philadelphia Magazine</em>‘s blog <em>The Philly Post</em>, may have a point. But going online-only would require a serious modernization of the Philly.com brand and site design.</p>

<p>I don’t see the ownership having the vision to invest in either branding or a design refresh, and if they do, I’m not confident they’ll pick the right people for the job. I hope I’m wrong, because the only sure thing about Philly’s major papers these days is that something needs to change fast.</p></div>
