<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4120208/why-andy-rubin-android-called-it-quits'>Google and Experimentation</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is a great article, especially if you don&#8217;t know much about the history of Android. However, Adrianne Jeffries of <em>The Verge</em> ends her article with a silly quote from Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. Perhaps analysts have a legitimate role to play in the consumer electronics industry, but this statement doesn&#8217;t support that thesis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I think Google doesn’t necessarily know what it’s going to do until Google has done it," said Gartenberg, the Gartner analyst. "I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s going to be some experimentation here."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google, the data-driven engineer&#8217;s paradise knows what it&#8217;s doing before it has done it. Experimentation is not, in Google&#8217;s world, akin to musical improvisation. Experiments in any setting are, if done right, rigorously planned and researched, and then executed with careful precision.</p>

<p>Google will heed the data, and the market climate, and the reaction to rumors about a commingled Android/Chrome OS, and myriad other factors. And they will <em>definitely</em> know what they&#8217;re doing before they do it.</p></div>
