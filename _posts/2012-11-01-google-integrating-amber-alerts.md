<a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/amber-alerts-for-missing-children-now.html'>Google integrating AMBER alerts</a><div class="link_description"><p>Richard Dunlop-Walters&#8217; <em>The Brief</em> is a must-read for those interested in news about how technology affects our lives every day.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlop-Walters <a href="http://thebrief.io/2012/thursday-november-1st/#google_adds_missing_children_to_list_of_things_it_can_help_find" target="_blank">said of Google&#8217;s AMBER Alert integration</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>whenever you perform a Google search related to an area where a child has been abducted and an alert was issued youâ€™ll see an AMBER Alert on the results page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great example of how a company can make money <em>and</em> help society, and do both using its core technology (in this case, search targeting). The best part? Google is working on expanding the integration internationally in cooperation with foreign missing children&#8217;s advocates.</p></div>
