<a href='https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-represent-bloggers-against-copyright-troll'>EFF will represent targets of copyright troll Prenda Law</a><div class="link_description"><p>Copyright trolls sue lots of people to extract settlements from those who can&#8217;t afford to litigate in the face of potentially massive statutory damages. Their claims are often facially lacking in merit and instead leverage intimidation and poorly-constructed federal copyright damages provisions to bankrupt people for profit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m impressed by Wordpress&#8217; parent company, Automattic, who refused to respond to the troll&#8217;s fishing expedition. And it&#8217;s good to see EFF lend a hand here in the form of representation, but eventually Congress needs to step in and fix the statutory damages provisions that incentivize copyright trolls to this vile abuse of our legal system in the first place.</p>
