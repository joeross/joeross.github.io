<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/technology/employers-social-media-policies-come-under-regulatory-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0I'>NLRB refines position on employee social media and workplace criticism</a><div class="link_description"><p>My personal policy is to refrain from discussing work on social media. In all my years of Twitter-ing and Facebook-ing, I&#8217;ve posted only a very few work-related updates, invariably focused on interpersonal minutiae like elevator rudeness. I think it&#8217;s just best to leave work at work. However, as the <em>Times</em>'s Steven Greenhouse reports, the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/category/case-number/03-ca-027872" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Board</a> recently ruled that conversational exchanges about working conditions between multiple employees on social media may be construed as the kind of concerted activity protected by the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> story to which I link in this post&#8217;s headline mentions at least two instances (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/technology/employers-social-media-policies-come-under-regulatory-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;#p%5BTNhfl%5D" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/technology/employers-social-media-policies-come-under-regulatory-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;#p%5BTaaUan%5D" target="_blank">here</a><sup id="fnref:p41292635932-1"><a href="p41292635932-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup>) where the termination of lone complainers was upheld by the NLRB. This ruling suggests that my personal policy is a safe bet: there&#8217;s no way to engage in concerted activity if you&#8217;re venting alone.</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> like those fancy paragraph-specific links the <em>Times</em> has on its digital articles. <a href="p41292635932-1" rev="footnote" target="_blank">↩</a></p>
