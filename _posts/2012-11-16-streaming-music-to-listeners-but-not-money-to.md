<a href='http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8993-the-cloud/'>Streaming music to listeners, but not money to artists</a><div class="link_description"><p>Galaxie 500 drummer Damon Krukowski<sup id="fnref:p35844181348-1"><a href="p35844181348-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, writing at <em>Pitchfork</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since we own our own recordings, by my calculation it would take songwriting royalties for roughly 312,000 plays on Pandora to earn us the profit of one&#8212; one&#8212; LP sale. (On Spotify, one LP is equivalent to 47,680 plays.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m a happy user of <a href="http://www.rdio.com" target="_blank">Rdio</a>, which is Spotify&#8217;s primary competitor. My fiancée and I pay $17.99 per month for Rdio&#8217;s unlimited streaming and downloading to our phones. At first glance, Mr. Krukowski&#8217;s article calls the morality of that set-up into question, particularly for someone who wishes he could make a living on <a href="http://joeross.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">his own music</a>.</p>

<p>Some streaming subscribers probably buy more records than non-streamers as a result of discovering new musicians or getting so attached to a record that streaming it just isn&#8217;t enough. But Mr. Krukowski casts serious doubt on the idea that streaming can, in any way meaningful to artists, replace the CD/vinyl/iTunes mode of music distribution.</p>
