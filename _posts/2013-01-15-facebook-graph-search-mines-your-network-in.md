</a><div class="link_description"><p>I predict it will be panned because it&#8217;s not &#8220;sexy&#8221; enough for the expectations Facebook raised, but that it will also be widely-used. It looks to me like one of those things people don&#8217;t know they want until a company offers it to them. I&#8217;m excited to give it a try later on and I&#8217;ll probably write up more thoughts on it later.</p></div>
