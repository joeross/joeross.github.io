<a href='http://www.journalism.org/2013/11/04/twitter-news-consumers-young-mobile-and-educated/'>Twitter news readers are educated, mobile, and young</a><div class="link_description"><p>Thoughts on this data from a business journal&#8217;s digital editor (me):</p>

<p>Pew announced empirical evidence of something I&#8217;ve anecdotally observed for a long time. And it underlines the importance for companies, especially publications, to get the hell onto Twitter and start being authentic about it.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p><span>The people there today are going to keep aging, keep making money, and keep inculcating themselves and their preferences into business and society.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s why I spend so much time with Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/njbiz" title="NJBIZ on Twitter" target="_blank">NJBIZ</a>. Our print readership skews older, male, executive.</p>

<p>And I when I say skews I mean <em>skews</em>.</p>

<p>Twitter is the best place to find out what younger news junkies want from a business (or any) publication. We&#8217;ve seen inbound traffic from Twitter surge recently, and it&#8217;s no accident: I spend time there. I use to tools to help keep the links flowing when I&#8217;m not at the switch, but the most important thing I do every day is reach out to those who follow or retweet.</p>

<p>And the most important component of that outreach is to those sharing links who don&#8217;t @ mention you, who don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re on Twitter yet. Most of them include positive sentiment and will automatically follow and continue to share if you acknowledge them. Those sharing negative sentiment can be addressed appropriately or, at the very least, retweeted without comment. It&#8217;s a good way to signal you take criticism seriously.</p>

<p>Takeaway: if you&#8217;re a B2C business of any kind and you&#8217;re not on Twitter, someone in charge at your company is either ignorant of the data or incompetent about its implications.</p></div>
