<p><em>This is a post I ran recently at my Posterous blog, announcing my move over here. I thought I&#8217;d put it here for reference while I finish drafting a proper post about how my personal take on blogging has evolved over the years.</em></p>

<hr><p>Dear people who read this website,</p>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to tell you:</p>

<ol><li>I made a new website. It&#8217;s located at <a href="http://joeross.me" target="_blank">http://joeross.me</a>. It is called &#8220;By Joe Ross.&#8221; The title may not be creative, but the content will be good. </li>
<li>I made it because <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/03/welcoming-posterous-team-to-flock.html" target="_blank">Twitter bought Posterous</a> in mid-March, and <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/big-news" target="_blank">Posterous hasn&#8217;t said a word to its users since</a>. I trust they will give users notice before a shutdown, but TweetDeck has mostly stagnated in the wake of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/25/twitter-confirms-tweetdeck-acquisition" target="_blank">its acquisition by Twitter</a>, and I don&#8217;t want to keep investing my content in something that will potentially go away soon. </li>
<li>My Posterous blog, from now on, will consist only of links to new posts at my new blog. </li>
<li>My new site is a Wordpress.org installation registered via <a href="http://hover.com" target="_blank">Hover.com</a> and hosted (for now, at least) with <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank">HostGator</a>. </li>
<li>My new blog will focus on law and technology, and how the two intersect. There won&#8217;t be many images, because finding images for posts has been a distraction for me and I want to focus on what I&#8217;m saying. </li>
<li>My new blog won&#8217;t include <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/pets" target="_self">photos of my pets</a>, <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/gaming" target="_self">thoughts about gaming</a> (unless there&#8217;s a legal or new-tech angle), or <a href="http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/food" target="_self">posts about food</a>. That kind of stuff will live at <a href="http://joeross.tumblr.com" target="_blank">my Tumblr</a>. </li>
<li>I will be importing relevant posts from my Posterous blog to my new blog over the next several weeks. I won&#8217;t post links to those on the Posterous, since that&#8217;s where they came from. </li>
<li>I will maintain my Posterous blog for as long as Posterous maintains their service. </li>
<li>There are at least thirty folks subscribed to my Posterous blog&#8217;s RSS feed. Thanks for that! But my new feed is <a href="http://joeross.me/feed" target="_blank">here</a>, so update your reader. The feed will remain full-content. </li>
<li>I&#8217;m excited to write more during the summer due to a lighter course load, and I hope you like the new site.</li>
</ol><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Joe</p>
