[Appeals court keeps immigration policy on hold](http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/05/appeals-court-keeps-immigration-policy-on-hold/)

Lyle Denniston writes at SCOTUSBlog:

> Under the policy, some 4.3 million individuals who entered the country illegally and remained without permission would be given a status of “lawful presence” in this country — well short of citizenship, and with no guarantee that they could stay even for the three-year delay period specified — and would qualify for both some federal benefits, like work permits, and some state benefits, like drivers’ licenses.

I spoke with immigration attorneys recently about the avalanche of work this policy is expected to generate if it ever goes into effect. There are many people whose future depends largely on the outcome of the ongoing dispute about the legality of the program.
