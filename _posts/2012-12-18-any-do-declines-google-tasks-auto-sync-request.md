<p><em>Thanks for the visit. If you enjoy this post, have a look at <a href="/tagged/articles" target="_blank">some of my other articles</a> or follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/joeross" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>.</em></p>

<hr><p>I got a depressing email this morning from one of my favorite task managers on Android, <a href="http://www.any.do/" target="_blank">Any.DO</a>. The feature request <a href="http://anydoandroid.uservoice.com/forums/166919-general/suggestions/3003697-auto-sync-all-changes-with-google-tasks" target="_blank">"Auto sync all changes with Google tasks"</a> was marked by Any.DO staff as &#8220;declined&#8221; this morning, despite having over 1,000 user votes. The next-most-voted-for feature is <a href="http://anydoandroid.uservoice.com/forums/166919-general/suggestions/2992540-sync-with-google-calendar" target="_blank">"Sync with Google Calendar"</a> and that <em>only</em> has 660 votes. People clearly want auto-sync.</p>

<p>Any.DO&#8217;s reason for declining auto-sync?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Tasks API is not very reliable. You can use Any.DO for Chrome instead (thereâ€™s an amazing Gmail integration you have to try!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My absolute favorite task manager on Android is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks" target="_blank">Tasks</a> (no, they&#8217;re not affiliated with Google). Tasks has an Android-native design aesthetic that is just as pleasing as Any.DO&#8217;s, but for different reasons. The app has had auto-sync with Google Tasks for a while. It was unreliable during their beta implementation, but now it&#8217;s very reliable.</p>

<p>Tasks auto-syncs to and from my Google Tasks every six hours (it can do 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours). Any.DO&#8217;s manual Google Tasks sync is four taps into the menu, when a minor change would place it at two taps. One is still better, and auto-sync is still best, but I suppose I need to accept that they&#8217;re not interested in being a pretty front-end for Google Tasks.</p>

<p>Any.DO has a wonderful design team. The app is beautiful. And I go back once in a while to play with it, but, without that auto-sync, I&#8217;m always digging into menus to make sure my tasks show up in Gmail and Calendar, where I spend much of my time while on a computer.</p>

<p>The simple conclusion is that if you want seamless, fire-and-forget Google Tasks integration on Android, you should drop 99 cents and get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks.paid" target="_blank">Tasks without the ads</a>. If you don&#8217;t use Google Tasks or are considering alternatives and auto-sync is not on your list of deal-breakers, try <a href="http://www.any.do/" target="_blank">Any.DO</a>.</p>
