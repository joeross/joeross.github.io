<p>I wanted to post something brief to let you know I made a few small but (I think) useful additions to this site.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>First, I&#8217;ve added a button to the bottom of all posts letting Twitter users reply or ask questions directly from the post. Thanks to the purveyor of <a href="http://kaos.am/post/31065995043" target="_blank">kaos.am</a> for unknowingly alerting me to this classy and subtle way to allow some direct communication without resorting to comments. Find more info on my no-comments policy <a href="http://joeross.me/comments" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Second, all of my <a href="http://joeross.me/tagged/articles" target="_blank">article</a> posts now include a &#8220;Read Later&#8221; button that will send that post to your <a href="http://instapaper.com" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> account. If you don&#8217;t have an Instapaper account, you should consider getting one. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/subscription" target="_blank">not free</a>, but it&#8217;s worth paying for the knowledge that it won&#8217;t &#8220;pivot&#8221; or become ad-ridden sometime down the road. Instapaper also innovates frequently, doing things like <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2012/01/13/instapaper-on-the-kindle/" target="_blank">Kindle integration</a> and <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/32233350372" target="_blank">fonts for vision-impaired readers</a> before anyone else.</p>

<p>Third, I&#8217;ve added some more feed options to the site. The original Tumblr feed is still available. However, you can now choose between a master feed including all updates, a links-only feed that only includes the links I share (updated at least once a day), or an articles-only feed that includes only longer articles (updated at least once a week). Find more information <a href="http://joeross.me/subscribe" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. I hope you find at least one of these additions useful. I don&#8217;t plan to add to this site very often, as part of the goal in building it was to keep it clean and content-focused.</p>
