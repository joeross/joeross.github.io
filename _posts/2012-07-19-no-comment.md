<p>I have turned off comments here at <em>Constant &amp; Endless</em>. I have had only one comment since I started writing here, from Mr. Scott Carpenter. He left a good link, and I certainly don&#8217;t want to alienate him or anyone else who wants to tell me something in response to what I&#8217;ve written.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>But I trust that Scott and anyone else reading this will find it easy to reply to my posts using the avenues listed on my <a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> page, or described in the posts by others I have linked to later in this piece.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t turn off comments at <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com" target="_blank"><em>Fiction By Joe Ross</em></a> (where, it turns out, Scott has also contributed valuable comments) because it&#8217;s good to have proposed revisions or critiques right there on the page. This site, however, is a different beast. I could write a long post about why I think this is the right move for most if not all personal small (from one to a few authors) commentary blogs, but the decision is already well-defended by people with bigger audiences (for now&#8230;muhahaha) than I.</p>

<p>iOS and Mac OS X developer Matt Gemmell wrote on his popular blog in November 2011 what I consider a bullet-proof reasoning for keeping comments out of personal blogs. He also has great suggestions for different (and, in his opinion and mine, better) ways to respond to something someone has written on their blog. If you don&#8217;t understand why I turned off comments here, read his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/" target="_blank">initial post</a> and his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/01/03/comments-still-off/" target="_blank">follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>MG Sielger, a general partner at <a href="http://www.crunchfund.com" target="_blank">CrunchFund</a>, a columnist at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/mg-siegler/" target="_blank"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, and purveyor of <a href="http://parislemon.com/" target="_blank"><em>parislemon</em></a> and <a href="http://massivegreatness.com/" target="_blank"><em>Massive Greatness</em></a>, chimed in on Gemmell&#8217;s posts with some thoughts of his own. If you still want some more explanation after reading Gemmell&#8217;s posts, read Siegler&#8217;s <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15288210624/comments-still-off" target="_blank">initial post</a> and his <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15305835451/bile" target="_blank">follow-up</a>.</p>
