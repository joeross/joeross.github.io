[What's better for free speech on reddit, saving a single thread or getting the whole site unbanned in Russia?](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/13/reddit-responds-after-being-threatened-banned-and-unbanned-by-the-russian-government/)

If the choice is between *all of reddit* remaining banned in *most of Russia* and IP-blocking access to one thread about mushrooms, I'd block access to the thread. I think there's a far stronger "pro-free-speech" argument for restoring access to 99.99% of reddit for Russians rather than inciting a total ban by refusing to restrict access to a single post.
