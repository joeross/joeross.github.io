<p>I&#8217;ve tried almost every plain text writing environment out there. I use native applications to write long pieces on desktop or laptop computers, but I often long for a great web experience for those times when I&#8217;m away from a Mac, or at a friend&#8217;s house or something.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;ve found one. Today, Nate Kontney <a href="http://ninjasandrobots.com/write-better-draft" target="_blank">officially announced Draft</a>. It&#8217;s a web-based plaint text writing environment, and anyone who frequently finds themselves writing in a web browser will <em>love</em> it.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried a couple of web-based text editors, and even one that can save to Dropbox. I&#8217;m not going to link to it here, but it&#8217;s easy enough to find. Instead, I&#8217;m going to encourage anyone who writes in plain text and wants a clean environment in which to do it on the web to check out <a href="http://draftin.com/" target="_blank">Draft</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been beta testing it for a couple of weeks and Nate has been impressive in his responsiveness to suggestions, especially considering that I&#8217;m one of 1,500 people who had been helping him with the beta. Draft supports Markdown, export as HTML, and file management using Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote, Box, and local storage. Add to those built-in dead-simple version control, collaboration, and the option to drop a few dollars for a professional review, and you&#8217;ve got the best web-based writing environment I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<p>Again, you just have to <a href="http://draftin.com" target="_blank">try it</a>. The design here is wonderful, with plenty of white space drawing your eyes and your cursor to the functional bits. Bold colors and crisp typography make it easy and pleasant to use.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a designer, but I like to write about the topic here, and I think it&#8217;s worth saying that my personal position on design is that it should be delightful and useful. One without the other risks either silliness or ugliness. But apps that both delight and prove useful are compelling in the proper sense of that word, in that they <em>compel</em> people to keep using them. Nate nailed that on Draft, and the best part is that he says this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Draft is an example of my favorite kind of tool, something built:</p>

<ol><li>for one primary purpose, and </li>
<li>because it enables the builder to do something they <em>really</em> want to do</li>
</ol><p>Tools built this way and for this reason tend to remain focused on fine-tuning and usability far longer than average because the builder has some genuine non-economic skin in the game. In other words, people make <em>good</em> tools when they think they&#8217;re going to make some money, but people make <em>great</em> tools when they need something they&#8217;ll enjoy using every day.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s why I love Marco Arment&#8217;s <a href="http://instapaper.com" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>, far and away my favorite reading app, and it&#8217;s why I love <a href="http://draftin.com" target="_blank">Draft</a>, now far and away my favorite writing app.</p>
