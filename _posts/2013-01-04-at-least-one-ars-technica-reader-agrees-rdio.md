<a href='http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/01/ars-readers-recommend-apps-for-your-new-ipad-or-ipad-mini/'>At least one Ars Technica reader agrees: Rdio &gt; Spotify</a><div class="link_description"><p><em>Ars Technica</em> reader jamieskella, contributing to Chris Foresman&#8217;s reader recommendation round-up for all those newly-gifted iPads out there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How and why is Spotify still being recommended when Rdio (free) boasts 18 million songs and is available in so many regions globally? The supremely intuitive app experience leaves Spotify in the dust, the social features add to the already first-rate discovery options, while the method of cataloguing your favourite music is far superior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, it still pains me that so many people got hooked on Spotify via Facebook and never learned of Rdio&#8217;s obvious superiority.</p></div>
