<a href='http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/ftc-facial-recognition-guidelines.php'>FTC Publishes Facial Recognition Guidelines</a><div class="link_description"><p>Carl Franzen, of <em>TPM Idea Lab</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two cases where the FTC believes that companies need to get a consumer’s “affirmative express consent,” that is, an “opt-in,” before using information captured via facial recognition: When identifying anonymous individuals to third parties that wouldn’t otherwise know who they were, and when using any data or imagery captured via facial recognition for purposes outside of what was initially stated by the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is good news because it signals awareness on the part of the FTC that this is an issue. Mr. Franzen provides some good context in his article, so if this stuff interests or worries you, click through to read his analysis. You can also find the FTC&#8217;s press release on the issue <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/facialrecognition.shtm" target="_blank">here</a>, the report itself, in PDF format, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2012/10/121022facialtechrpt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and the dissenting statement of Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch, also in PDF format, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2012/10/121022fr_jtr_dissentingstmnt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>
