<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/16/4113922/flickr-iphone-app-updated-with-hashtags'>Nope, Flickr's hashtags aren't news either</a><div class="link_description"><p><em>WSJ</em> was wrong to <a href="http://joeross.me/post/45364371503/dear-wall-street-journal-why-is-facebooks-hashtag" target="_blank">pretend potential Facebook hashtags are news</a>, and everyone reporting about a similar move by Flickr is just as wrong.</p>

<p>What makes this even <em>less</em> news is that Flickr has so far only started calling their longtime tags feature &#8220;hashtags&#8221; in their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flickr/id328407587?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS app</a>.</p></div>
