<a href='http://thetechblock.com/interview-mailbox-gentry-underwood/'>An interview with Mailbox founder Gentry Underwood</a><div class="link_description"><p>Abdel Ibrahim, interviewing <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox</a> founder Gentry Underwood at <em>The Tech Block</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Any plans for an Android app?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Definitely. Startups focus or die, so we picked one device (iPhone) and one platform (Gmail) to start, but we’ve designed our infrastructure from the beginning to support scaling to other devices and platforms as quickly and easily as possible once we feel Mailbox is “working” on the first set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good news, because it&#8217;s beautifully-designed and functionality looks to be top of mind from the screenshots I&#8217;ve seen.</p></div>
