<a href='http://www.netnewscheck.com/article/23018/inquirer-daily-news-to-split-from-phillycom'>Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News splitting into separate paywall sites</a><div class="link_description"><p>Gawker&#8217;s Hamilton Nolan&#8217;s <a href="http://gawker.com/5966560" target="_blank">theory of the paywall</a> suggests a local paper of high caliber can survive erecting a paywall.</p>

<p>Maybe he is right, but can <em>two</em> local papers survive?</p>

<p>It will be good to see the <em>Inquirer</em> and the <em>Daily News</em> broken out into their own websites, if only for the fact that they have very different voices. But, as <a href="http://philly.com" target="_blank">Philly.com</a> is currently an amalgam of the two, with its own original content as well, I&#8217;m curious to see what it will look like after the websites split.</p></div>
