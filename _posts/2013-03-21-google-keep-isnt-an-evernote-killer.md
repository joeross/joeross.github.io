<p>Evernote will be just fine, despite Google&#8217;s recent announcement of a new note-taking app called Google <a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keep-save-whats-on-your-mind.html" target="_blank">Keep</a>, currently available for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/keep/" target="_blank">web</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep" target="_blank">Android</a>. Keep allows for text, audio, and images to be added to a single notebook and synced between the web and Android devices. You can even add stuff via <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" target="_blank">Google Now</a>. It&#8217;s neat, but it&#8217;s no Evernote killer.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>The two products cater to very different use cases, and Keep will not be able to replace Evernote for its core customers. Evernote had <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-in-no-rush-to-make-users-pay-2012-11" target="_blank">1.5 million premium subscribers in November 2012</a>. At 45$/year, that&#8217;s around $67 million annually, and the number of subscribers has been rising for years.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t make them profitable, at least at the moment, but it helps. Coupled with Business accounts and other endeavors, Evernote isn&#8217;t worried. For those premium users, who pay because they make the most of Evernote&#8217;s vast feature set, Keep won&#8217;t be good enough. And I suspect that even if every user of Evernote&#8217;s free tier left the product, Evernote would hardly notice from an operational standpoint (if anything, operational costs would decrease).</p>

<p>Instead, makers of task management apps should be concerned. <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/" target="_blank">Google Tasks</a> is as neglected as <a href="http://google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> was, and we all know <a href="http://joeross.me/post/45306123154/powering-down-google-reader" target="_blank">what happened to Reader</a>. Keep looks like an elegant upgrade to Google Tasks, and while Evernote has <a href="http://joeross.me/post/42849599646/evernote-ceo-hints-at-future-task-management" target="_blank">hinted at its own task management solution</a>, I don&#8217;t think the future of their business will depend on it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth remembering: there just aren&#8217;t as many zero-sum games in the apps and services spaces as many, especially in the tech press, would have us believe. Design, feature set nuance, and adaptability to users&#8217; current workflow all allow for multiple apps to be successful in the same space. The Keep/Evernote dichotomy is no different.</p>
