<a href='http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/24/un-launches-probe-us-drone-attacks/'>U.N. to investigate use of drones, Washington Times bad at headlines</a><div class="link_description"><p>The UN investigation will examine the use of drone strikes by 51 nations. The US is certainly major user of the automated strike machines, but  Cheryl K. Chumley of the <em>Washington Times</em>, and her editor, made the unfortunate mistake of injecting their opinion into a news story&#8217;s headline. The UN is not probing <em>only</em> US drone use, as the headline strongly implies.</p>

<p>Poor headlining<sup id="fnref:p41699913575-1"><a href="p41699913575-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup> aside, this is a story to watch, because I don&#8217;t anticipate US cooperation.</p>

<p>I changed &#8220;reporting&#8221; to &#8220;headlining&#8221; on January 29, 2013. The reporting is actually well-done, hence my self-correction. <a href="p41699913575-1" rev="footnote" target="_blank">↩</a></p>
