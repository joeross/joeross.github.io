<a href='http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/06/hootsuite-acquires-seesmic-interview-loic-le-meur/'>HootSuite Buys Seesmic</a><div class="link_description"><p>Robins Wauters interviewed Seesmic founder Loïc Le Meur at <em>The Next Web</em> today on his company&#8217;s sale to rival HootSuite.</p>

<p>I have always thought Seesmic was the best multi-profile app for Twitter and Facebook on mobile, and I always preferred their web interface to Hootsuite&#8217;s. But Le Meur is a brilliant fellow, and, as long as his team is taken care of, via either jobs at Hootsuite or decent compensation, I can only be happy for Seesmic.</p>
