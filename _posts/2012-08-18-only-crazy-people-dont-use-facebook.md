<a href='http://mashable.com/2012/08/07/no-facebook-psychopath/'>Only crazy people don't use Facebook?</a><div class="link_description"><p>Zoe Fox, writing at <em>Mashable</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Employers may suspect that an applicant&#8217;s absence from the social network means the account is so full of offensive material that it had to be deleted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what if I deleted my Facebook account because my <em>friends&#8217;</em> accounts were so full of offensive material? Regardless, I certainly don&#8217;t want to work for someone who makes psychological judgments about me 1) without a relevant degree or experience making such diagnoses and 2) without any significant interaction with me.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s job market, unfortunately, may leave some people without a choice: create and maintain a net-positive Facebook account or risk being overlooked for an interview. Then again, one study does not scientific fact make. And there&#8217;s my generally positive <a href="http://twitter.com/joeross" target="_blank">Twitter presence</a>, for what it&#8217;s worth.</p></div>
