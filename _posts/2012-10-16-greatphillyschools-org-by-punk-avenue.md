<a href='http://punkave.com/window/2012/10/15/great-philly-schools-information-matters'>GreatPhillySchools.org, by P’unk Avenue</a><div class="link_description"><p><a href="http://punkave.com/" target="_blank">P&#8217;unk Ave</a> is a &#8220;purpose-driven agency&#8221; of talented Philly geeks who build websites, created <a href="http://apostrophenow.org/" target="_blank">their own open-source CMS</a>, and generally enjoy work that really <em>does</em> something, especially in their city and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="http://greatphillyschools.org/" target="_blank">GreatPhillySchools.org</a> is a well-crafted comparison engine for determining which of Philly&#8217;s schools is the best for your child. The database covers all public, private, charter, and parochial schools. This tool helps to narrow the field, and elminate underperforming schools, empowering you to give the promising ones the attention worthy of such an important decision. Maybe I sound like I&#8217;m writing a press release for them, but I really like their work and they <em>produce</em>.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way: I was in a lot of bands in high school and college. There were always two kinds of bands: the kids that were there for the &#8220;scene,&#8221; to observe and be observed, and the kids that were there for the <em>music</em>, to <em>do</em> and to <em>learn</em>.</p>

<p>P&#8217;unk Ave are the second kind of people, and that&#8217;s why I love the stuff they do.</p></div>
