<a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/11/aol-crunchbase-cc-flap/'>AOL lawyers don't understand Creative Commons. At all.</a><div class="link_description"><p>David Kravets writes at <em>Wired</em> about AOL&#8217;s demand that an app called <a href="http://getpeopleplus.com/" target="_blank">People+</a> stop using a complete replica of AOL&#8217;s tech company database.</p>

<p>AOL&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank">CrunchBase</a> is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank">licensed</a> under Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/" target="_blank">Attribution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We provide CrunchBase&#8217;s content under the Creative Commons Attribution License [CC-BY].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the <a href="http://info.crunchbase.com/docs/terms-of-service/" target="_blank">terms of service</a> for the same product say, with my emphasis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CrunchBase reserves the right</strong> in its sole discretion (for any reason or for no reason) and at anytime without notice to You <strong>to</strong> change, suspend or discontinue the CrunchBase API and/or <strong>suspend or terminate your rights</strong> under these General Terms of Service <strong>to</strong> access, <strong>use</strong> and/<strong>or display</strong> the CrunchBase API, Brand Features and<strong>any CrunchBase content</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, as AOL attorneys should know (but apparently don&#8217;t), the company cannot reserve any such right at all, at least as to any data accessed, used or displayed while the Creative Commons license is still in effect, which it is as of November 6, 2013.</p>

<p>AOL <em>can</em> legally prohibit <em>future</em> access, use and display, but once content is under a Creative Commons attribution license one reserves <em>no</em> rights whatsoever, except the right to attribution.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s baffling that AOL lawyers would assert otherwise.</p></div>
