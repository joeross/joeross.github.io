<a href='http://www.marco.org/2012/07/26/not-just-geeks'>Geek preferences matter</a><div class="link_description"><blockquote>
  <p>We installed Firefox on every non-geek’s computer we could find. And while we were there, we set everyone’s search engine to Google instead of Yahoo or MSN, and we made fun of their AOL email addresses until they switched to Gmail. Our preferences matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took this quote somewhat out of context and Marco Arment&#8217;s post about how Apple&#8217;s new OS X Mountain Lion handles third party app is worth reading.</p>

<p>I just particularly like the reminder that geeks, who sometimes feel marginalized, are often setting trends.</p></div>
