I&#8217;m happy to report that, according to <em>Reuters</em>, the 24-year-old has been &#8220;pardoned&#8221; and will be able to go back to Norway.</p>

<p>The fact that UAE called it a &#8220;pardon&#8221; is as unconscionable as the sentence itself, but freedom by any name is better than being jailed in the kind of nation that would punish a rape victim.</p></div>
