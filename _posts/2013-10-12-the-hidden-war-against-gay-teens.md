<a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-hidden-war-against-gay-teens-20131010'>The Hidden War Against Gay Teens</a><div class="link_description"><p>Alex Morris wrote a great piece at <em>Rolling Stone</em> about what can only be called the social abuse being perpetrated at Christian schools.</p>

<p>You should know before you read the quote below that “they” refers to the leadership of one of the Christian schools discussed in Morris’ article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"They found out she was a lesbian, and they made her go in front of the entire school and tell them," says Tristan. "And then they kicked her out the next day."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was raised Catholic.</p>

<p>I know the Bible inside and out.</p>

<p>I read it twice, cover to cover, in addition to about 16 years of Catholic-affiliated schooling.</p>

<p>I know Catholicism and other forms of Christianity are sometimes mutually unintelligible.</p>

<p>But there is nothing, <em>absolutely nothing</em>, Christian about behavior like that by an adult authority figure.</p>

<p>To out someone against their will, before their peers, only to cast them out afterward, as a means to teach them they are inferior, is the very definition if evil.</p>

<p>It is petty, resentful and indicative of a disgusting superiority complex coupled with a total lack of moral intelligence.</p></div>
