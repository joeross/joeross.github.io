<p><a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/05/best-of-twitter-in-your-inbox.html" target="_blank">Othman Laraki, Director of Growth and International at Twitter, on the official <em>Twitter Blog</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like other Twitter email notifications, you can manage your preferences for this new digest in your <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/notifications" target="_blank">Notification Settings</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is true, but Twitter has opted all users into their new weekly email digest. If you don&#8217;t want it, you&#8217;ll have to opt out of it. The quoted line is a half-assed way of telling us that.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Twitter is (<a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/19/marco-arment-be-skeptical-of-twitters-innovators-patent-agreement/" target="_blank">arguably</a>) <a href="http://joeross.me/blog/2012/04/17/twitter-wont-use-employee-patents-offensively/" target="_blank">progressive on patents</a> and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/08/twitter-motion-to-quash/" target="_blank">protective of privacy</a>, so I won&#8217;t spend hundreds of words criticizing them on this particular point, but it&#8217;s worth noting.</p>

<p>Companies introducing new features always have two options:</p>

<ol><li>Companies that force users to opt-out of new features may create annoyance, project a lack of confidence in the feature&#8217;s likelihood of organic adoption, and give users occasion to second-guess other features the company offers while they&#8217;re busy trying to turn off the new stuff in their settings panel.  </li>
<li>Conversely, companies that allow users to opt into new features may create goodwill, cause organic word-of-mouth dissemination (much more powerful than the forced version), and help to stagger adoption of resource-intensive features, allowing them to successfully scale.</li>
</ol><p>I don&#8217;t understand why more companies don&#8217;t go with the second option. I find it hard to believe that blind adoption by users too underinformed or lazy to opt-out is somehow more valuable than voluntary adoption.</p>

<p>But the persistence of opt-out feature introductions suggests companies believe exactly that, whether or not it&#8217;s accurate.</p>
