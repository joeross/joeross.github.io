<a href='http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/'>Transitioning from Google Reader to feedly</a><div class="link_description"><p>From the Feedly blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have been working on a project called Normandy which is a feedly clone of the Google Reader API â€“ running on Google App Engine. When Google Reader shuts down, feedly will seamlessly transition to the Normandy back end. So if you are a Google Reader user and using feedly, you are covered: the transition will be seamless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feedly is my top contender for a Reader replacement right now: multi-platform, ready to clone my Reader feeds, and prepared to essentially take over much of Reader&#8217;s core subscribe-and-sync functionality when Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html" target="_blank">pulls the plug</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I can&#8217;t help but assume that they&#8217;re calling it Normandy because there are tens of thousands of Google Reader users <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord" target="_blank">suddenly storming their shores</a>.</p></div>
