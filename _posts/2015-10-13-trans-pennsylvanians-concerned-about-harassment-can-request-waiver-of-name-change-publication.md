*Let me preface this article by saying none of this is legal advice and I am not your lawyer. This article merely recites facts. Consult an attorney if necessary. The [Pennsylvania Legal Aid Network](http://www.palegalaid.net/resources/clients/legalhelpfinder) can assist you in finding a lawyer even if you don't think you can afford one.*

People choose to change their name for many reasons. Marriage is probably the most well-known and common of those reasons, but there are others. For example, people who choose to transition from their assigned gender to their real gender usually choose a new name that reflects their real gender. 

The Human Rights Campaign [reports](http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/a-national-crisis-anti-transgender-violence) that at least 20 transgender people have been murdered in 2015. A quick search of Google News will confirm that those murders were related to the victim's status as a transgendered person. 

A name change is only one data point among the many that may be used by criminals to identify potential victims as trans. This is possible because under the default Pennsylvania law an adult petitioning to change their name must publish notice of the name change to the public. There is, however, an exception to that requirement.

A petitioner for a name change can ask the judge to waive the publication of notice requirement, and:

> If the court finds that the notice required in subparagraph (ii)[^1] would jeopardize the safety of the person seeking the name change or his or her child or ward, the notice required shall be waived by order of the court. Upon granting the request to waive any notice requirement, the court shall seal the file. In all cases filed under this paragraph, whether or not the name change petition is granted, there shall be no public access to any court record of the name change petition, proceeding or order, unless the name change is granted but the file is not sealed. The records shall only be opened by order of the court in which the petition was granted based upon a showing of good cause or at the applicant's request.

54 Pa.C.S. ยง 701(a.1)(3)(iii) ([HTML](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=54&div=0&chpt=7&sctn=1&subsctn=0) | [PDF](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/PDF/2004/0/0214..PDF))

People who are changing their name as part of a gender transition or any other circumstance which may put them in danger of harassment or worse by bigoted lunatic nutcases[^2] can ask that the notice be waived and the file sealed. 

If you can show that publication of your name change would "jeopardize [your] safety" the court is *required* to waive publication and seal the record.[^3]

I did some preliminary research on New Jersey name change requirements, which the courts explain in detail in [this PDF](https://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/prose/10551_namechg_adult.pdf). There does not appear to be a waiver option in the Garden State for trans people or anyone else. The [National Center for Transgender Equality](http://www.transequality.org/documents/state/new-jersey) points visitors to the same PDF but makes no mention of a waiver possibility. If I can find information to the contrary I will publish it in a future article.

[^1]: 54 Pa.C.S. ยง 701(a.1)(3)(ii) states that: "Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), by order, direct that notice be given of the filing of the petition and of the date set for the hearing on the petition and that the notice be treated as follows: (A)  Published in two newspapers of general circulation in the county where the petitioner resides or a county contiguous to that county. One of the publications may be in the official paper for the publication of legal notices in the county (B)  Given to any nonpetitioning parent of a child whose name may be affected by the proceedings."
