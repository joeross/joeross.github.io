<a href='http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/10_-_October/Judge_halts_Pennsylvania_s_controversial_voter_ID_law/'>PA Commonwealth Court: No Voter ID requirement this year</a><div class="link_description"><p>Mark Shade, writing at <em>Thompson Reuters</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The state of Pennsylvania has acknowledged that there has never been a case of in-person voter fraud, according to court testimony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This law was a transparent and admitted bad-faith effort by Republicans in Pennsylvania to disenfranchise a statistically significant number of voters in traditionally Democratic demographics.</p>

<p>To be clear, the ruling prevents the law from going into effect for next month&#8217;s election, but allows it to go into full effect next year.</p>

<p>Since there is no fraud anyway, any appeal will be a clear and explicit signal that the purpose of the law was, in fact, to prevent traditionally left-leaning people from casting a vote in November 2012.</p>
