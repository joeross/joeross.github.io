<blockquote>
  <p>To make the movie, [Randy] Moore wouldnâ€™t print out script pages or shot sequences for the 25 days he was filming on Disney turf, instead keeping all the info on iPhones. This way, when actors and crew were looking down between takes, passersby just thought they were glancing at their messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The films plot, such as it is, sounds as intriguing as its method of creation.</p>

<p>If it <em>does</em> get a distribution deal, Disney will most likely brings its formidable legal resources to bear upon it, and they&#8217;ll most likely succeed.</p>

<p>But I predict that the company will trigger a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect" target="_blank">Streisand effect</a>, perhaps as much to the filmmaker&#8217;s detriment as anyone else&#8217;s (to the extent that he hopes to recoup his investment), that will drive people to seek out and, in the era of digital file sharing, inevitably find the film.</p></div>
