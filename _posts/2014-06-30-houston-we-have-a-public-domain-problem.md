<a href='https://medium.com/@xor/houston-we-have-a-public-domain-problem-bd971c57dfdc'>Houston, We Have A Public Domain Problem</a><div class="link_description"><p>Parker Higgins of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, lamenting the recent removal of a public domain NASA clip he posted on the audio sharing site SoundCloud:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real goofy bit is that before I started at EFF, I worked at SoundCloud. I actually uploaded this Apollo 13 clip, along with sounds from Apollo 11 and others, as part of a project to attract more historic and archival audio and really celebrate the public domain as a rich source of sounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copyright law has been trending in favor of rights holders for a long time. Thatâ€™s precisely why unlawful claims of copyright over public domain works are so despicable.</p></div>
