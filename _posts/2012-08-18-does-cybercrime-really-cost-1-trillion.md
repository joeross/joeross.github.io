<a href='http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/08/cybercrime-one-trillion-symantec-macafee'>Does Cybercrime Really Cost $1 Trillion?</a><div class="link_description"><p>A spokeswoman for Senator Joe Lieberman, speaking to Peter Maass and Megha Rajagopalan of Mother Jones:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Senator Lieberman and his staff believe that McAfee, Symantec, and General Alexander are reputable sources of information about cybersecurity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence, in this case at least, would suggest otherwise, Mr. Senator.</p>

<p><em>Note: An earlier version of this post left out Megha Rajagopalan, a co-author of the cited ProPublica piece.</em></p></div>
