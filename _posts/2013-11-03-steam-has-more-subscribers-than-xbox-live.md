<a href='http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/30/valve-steam-65-million-users/'>Steam has more subscribers than Xbox Live</a><div class="link_description"><p>The Steam gaming network is now the number 2 community for gamers in the world. Sony&#8217;s PlayStation Network is on top with 110 million users, followed by Steam with 65 million. Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live network takes the third spot with 48 million subscribers.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>The Steam number is truly impressive because, unlike the other two on the list, <em>Steam has no console on the market yet</em>.</p>

<p>The PC-gaming market and multiplayer software maker expects to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/04/valve-steam-machines-beta-specs/" target="_blank">launch beta hardware soon</a>, but to take the second position without anything in households yet is quite a feat.</p></div>
