<p>Dearest readers,</p>

<p>I know, I know: it&#8217;s been a while. I moved, started a new job, got married, and am preparing for the bar exam. &#8220;Busy&#8221; is an insufficient descriptor. In case the new look hasn&#8217;t given it away, though, you can expect regular publishing to restart very soon.</p>

<p>Thanks for still reading.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Joe</p>
