<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

Last week I welcomed my Mom to the slowly-growing-but-still-single-digit subscriber list, and this week I took the liberty of adding my Dad. Today is his birthday so everyone wish him a happy birthday.

This week's agenda includes the consequences of New York's broken prison system, stories about the problems and progress of the struggle for transgender equality, and follow-up about last week's theft of the personal information of federal employees.

## [Teen Held at Rikers Island for 3 Years Without Trial Commits Suicide](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/nyregion/kalief-browder-held-at-rikers-island-for-3-years-without-trial-commits-suicide.html)

> Kalief Browder was sent to Rikers Island when he was 16 years old, accused of stealing a backpack. Though he never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime, he spent three years at the New York City jail complex, nearly two of them in solitary confinement.

An inefficient court system is no excuse for prolonged detention without charges, and there's a strong argument that what happened to Kalief Browder, whether he was guilty or not (and the evidence suggests he was not) was unconstitutional. The worst part is that the treatment that drove Browder to suicide is [endemic throughout Rikers Island](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/nyregion/rikers-officers-charged-in-2012-death-of-inmate.html) andthe New York prison system in general.

## [Google Must Expand Privacy Delistings, Says French Watchdog](http://social.techcrunch.com/2015/06/12/google-must-expand-privacy-delistings-says-french-watchdog/)

> The French data protection watchdog has ordered Google to widen its implementation of the so-called European 'right to be forgotten' so that links are also delisted from all Google domains, including google.com, not just (as is currently the case) from the .fr French subdomain.

The so-called "right to be forgotten" is a European concept, obviously supported by French regulators, that people are entitled to the removal of certain data about them from search engines and other data repositories.

It's understandable that some people would want such an option, especially given [what Google displays when you search for "Joseph Ross"](https://www.google.com/search?q=joseph+ross). I have made it my business to engage in positive work on the internet that will serve to increase my own ranking in search results for my name. Right now I first appear on page six of Google results, so I still have some work to do.

But it's unlikely Google will cave to France's unilateral demand for global compliance with its data protection laws. I'm not sure what the outcome will be, and even the [French press release](http://www.cnil.fr/english/news-and-events/news/article/cnil-orders-google-to-apply-delisting-on-all-domain-names-of-the-search-engine/) is vague, but I'll keep an eye on it.

## [Pa.'s new physician general brings an LGBT point of view](http://articles.philly.com/2015-01-26/news/58437758\_1\_gender-identity-lgbt-community-richard-levine)

> The governor's decision to appoint her was particularly bold given that in Pennsylvania it is still legal to fire employees for their sexual orientation or gender identity.

I'm torn about including this link. On the one hand, it's great news that her gender identity didn't prevent Governor Tom Wolf from nominating Dr. Levine. On the other hand, I still long for a world in which the gender identity of a political nominee is no longer newsworthy. This story provides great background on her, but it came out before the Senate voted on her nomination. I'm happy to say they have since confirmed her appointment.

## [Trans woman arrested in Baltimore riots, jailed among men](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/trans-woman-arrested-balitmore-riots-jailed-men-article-1.2205723)

> A transgender woman collared among the multitude of rioters during Baltimore's chaotic unrest on Monday was detained in men's quarters at the city jail, a defense attorney that oversaw the woman's bail hearing says.

One step forward, two steps back. 30-year-old Deairra Venable has been on hormones for years, resulting in, among other things, her development of breasts. Despite her gender identity and its visible physical manifestations, "Intake guards then took away her bra, gave her a sheer top and placed her in a small holding cell with several men. It was either that, or solitary confinement."

The time for lenient reactions like "the system needs time to change" is long gone. Venable is charged with burglary, and may in fact be a criminal. But we have never treated even convicted felons with arbitrary disregard for their gender. There is no excuse anymore for institutional discrimination like that displayed by Baltimore authorities in Ms. Venable's case.

## [Follow-up: Union says hackers have personnel data on every federal employee](http://bigstory.ap.org/af77f567a4b74f128a4869031dc9add9)

> J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a letter to OPM director Katherine Archuleta that based on the incomplete information the union received from OPM, 'We believe that the Central Personnel Data File was the targeted database, and that the hackers are now in possession of all personnel data for every federal employee, every federal retiree, and up to one million former federal employees.'

There isn't much more to say here. Last week, there was some question about how many employees were affected. And the Union's allegations are inferences from the lack of information provided by the Office of Personnel Management about the data breach, not on hard evidence.

Still, if you know any current or former federal employees it may be worth asking them what, guidance they have received thus far from the government about this breach.
