<a href='http://www.branded3.com/blogs/the-antisocial-network-path-texts-my-entire-phonebook-at-6am/'>Path is still spamming your contacts</a><div class="link_description"><p>If you’re a Path user, consider, er, reconsidering. <a href="https://twitter.com/pathservice/status/329277769991196672" target="_blank">This</a> is apparently the best they can do in response.</p>

<p>CNET’s Jennifer Van Grove was told that the #1 request from users is to find friends on Path, hence the aggressive “new-user flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why does “find my friends on Path&#8221; translate to the app’s creators as “invite everyone in my phone’s address book to use Path, without explaining that the message is automated and being sent because I opted in&#8221;&#160;?</p>

<p>I would be happy to advise Path on acceptable, reasonable on-boarding and invitation flows for a modest fee. I can be reached at JoeHelpsPath ( @ ) joeross ( . ) me.</p></div>
