<p><a href="http://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> CEO Linden Tibbets, in an email to users today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[ … ] on September 27th we will be removing all Twitter Triggers, disabling your ability to push tweets to places like email, Evernote and Facebook. All Personal and Shared Recipes using a Twitter Trigger will also be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IFTTT is everything <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo Pipes</a> could have been and I’ve been using several Twitter triggers for a long time, to do things like save my tweets to <a href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> and add favorite tweets to Instapaper.</p>

<p>My “Twitter” tag is becoming so littered with the company’s user-hostile decisions and their unfortunate consequences that, soon, it will make more sense to post something when and if they ever put users first again.</p>

<hr><p>Here’s the full email from IFTTT’s Linden:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear joeross,</p>
  
  <p>In recent weeks, Twitter announced policy changes* that will affect how applications and users like yourself can interact with Twitter’s data. As a result of these changes, on September 27th we will be removing all Twitter Triggers, disabling your ability to push tweets to places like email, Evernote and Facebook. All Personal and Shared Recipes using a Twitter Trigger will also be removed. Recipes using Twitter Actions and your ability to post new tweets via IFTTT will continue to work just fine.</p>
  
  <p>At IFTTT, first and foremost, we want to empower anyone to create connections between literally anything. We’ve still got a long way to go, and to get there we need to make sure that the types of connections that IFTTT enables are aligned with how the original creators want their tools and services to be used.</p>
  
  <p>We at IFTTT are big Twitter fans and, like yourself, we’ve gotten a lot of value out of the Recipes that use Twitter Triggers. We’re sad to see them go, but remain excited to build features that work within Twitter’s new policy. Thank you for your support and for understanding these upcoming changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@ifttt.com.</p>
  
  <p>Linden Tibbets IFTTT CEO</p>
  
  <p>*These Twitter policy changes specifically disallow uploading Twitter Content to a “cloud based service” (Section 4A <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms" target="_blank">https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms</a>) and include stricter enforcement of the Developer Display Requirements (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements" target="_blank">https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements</a>).</p>
