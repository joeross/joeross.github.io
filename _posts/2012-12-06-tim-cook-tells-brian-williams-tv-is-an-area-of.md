<blockquote>
  <p>“When I go into my living room and turn on the TV, I feel like I have gone backwards in time by 20 to 30 years,” Cook told Williams. “It’s an area of intense interest. I can’t say more than that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only interesting bit of the article. I&#8217;m not sure why he would tease it in an interview like this one, that will ostensibly reach a large viewership of non-geeks, unless they were <em>close</em> to their TV solution.</p>

<p>As an aside, &#8220;assembling&#8221; some iMacs in the US is not the same as &#8220;making&#8221; them here, and it&#8217;s a distinction I suspect will be lost on many.</p></div>
