<a href='http://gigaom.com/mobile/amazon-heads-off-app-fragmentation-on-kindle-fire-android/'>Amazon heads off app fragmentation on Kindle Fire, Android</a><div class="link_description"><p>Kevin C. Tofel, writing at <em>GigaOM</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This could mean vastly better tablet apps for the higher resolution Kindle Fires similar to the improved iPad apps that iOS developers made instead of scaled-up iPhone software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he&#8217;s right: assuming developers embrace this change, it can only bode well for the quality of app experiences for consumers.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not the only angle here, is it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a developer, so I have some questions. My questions imply their own answers, so correct me if I&#8217;m wrong:</p>

<ol><li>How is encouraging the development and maintenance of multiple simultaneous versions of an app going to be <em>helpful</em> to developers? </li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t each version come with its own bugs, complaints, and quirks?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t developers want easier ways to incorporate device flexibility into a single binary?</li>
</ol></div>
