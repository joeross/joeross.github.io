<a href='http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671129/infographic-a-map-of-america-s-284-drone-strikes-against-pakistan'>A Map Of America’s 284 Drone Strikes Against Pakistan</a><div class="link_description"><p>Cliff Kuang of <em>Co.Design</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever your stance on drone killings, the fact remains that there’s been very little national dialogue on the topic. Indeed, some would say that’s a direct result of the main problem with the policy: Its complete lack of transparency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Kuang points to the <em>New York Times</em> piece from this past June. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">It&#8217;s a good place to start</a>, and taken along with this the infographic, starts to bring the severity of the issue into focus.</p>

<p>Perhaps reasonable people will come to different conclusions, but if you don&#8217;t at least <em>have</em> an opinion on this, get one.</p></div>
