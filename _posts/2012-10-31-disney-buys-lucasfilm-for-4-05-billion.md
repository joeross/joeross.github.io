  <p>Kathleen Kennedy, current Co-Chairman of Lucasfilm, will become President of Lucasfilm, reporting to Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn. Additionally she will serve as the brand manager for Star Wars, working directly with Disney&#8217;s global lines of business to build, further integrate, and maximize the value of this global franchise. Ms. Kennedy will serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, with George Lucas serving as creative consultant. Star Wars Episode 7 is targeted for release in 2015, with more feature films expected to continue the Star Wars saga and grow the franchise well into the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t a fan of Episodes I, II, or III, and this deal doesn&#8217;t increase my hope for some sort of redemption in future <em>Star Wars</em> films. I predict this will lead to a slow, painful death of the franchise in the eyes of geeks and comic store-guys who may have still held out that same hope.</p>

<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong.</p></div>
