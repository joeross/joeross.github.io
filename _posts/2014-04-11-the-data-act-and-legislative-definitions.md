<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/04/10/the-data-act-just-passed-the-senate-heres-why-that-matters/'>The DATA Act and legislative definitions</a><div class="link_description"><p>Andrea Peterson reports<sup id="fnref:p82380823120-1"><a href="p82380823120-1" rel="footnote" target="_blank">1</a></sup> at <em>The Washington Post</em> the Senate has passed a bill, the DATA Act, which would require federal financial data be published in a common format. It sounds like a great idea and something those nerdy data journalists are going to <em>love</em>. The bill is likely to pass in the House as well, and the President is expected to autograph it.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, a part of the bill Peterson pointed out makes me nervous.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The version passed by the Senate doesn&#8217;t set a specific format for the data standard but does require it to be &#8220;a widely-accepted, nonproprietary, searchable, platform-independent computer readable format&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, to be clear, it&#8217;s probably better not to name a specific file format because those may come and go. But I&#8217;m hoping the final version of the law defines every word in that quoted bit, excepting &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;format&#8221; because if it doesn&#8217;t, implementation is going to be even slower than usual and enabling high-volume computerized public scrutiny of federal spending is really a the-sooner-the-better sort of topic.</p>

<p>The WaPo headline reads &#8220;The DATA Act just passed the Senate&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t look right to me. The Senate is the legislative body, which voted to pass the legislation. Not the other way around. Editorial picking of nits? Yes. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not an improvement. <a href="p82380823120-1" rev="footnote" target="_blank">↩</a></p>
