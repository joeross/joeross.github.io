<blockquote>
  <p>The North Carolina amendment alters the constitution to say that &#8220;marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized&#8221; in the state.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t often take a preachy tone, and this story has little to do with how the law and technology intersect, which is my usual topic on this website. However, I think people should be treated the same, and when they&#8217;re not, I get angry. When masses of people vote for something so clearly despicable that it can accurately be called <em>evil</em>, I have to get my thoughts about it out of my system.</p>

<p>And my thoughts about North Carolina&#8217;s ban on same-sex marriage are the following:</p>

<p>One day, the descendants of the 61% of North Carolinians who voted discrimination into their constitution today will look back on what their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents did on Tuesday, May 8, 2012 with disgust, much the same way we do when we read the state&#8217;s <a href="http://think-progress.tumblr.com/post/22691147682/the-last-time-north-carolina-amended-their" target="_blank">nonchalant 1875 ban on interracial marriage</a>.</p>

<p>To the 39% of folks in North Carolina who voted with morals, ethics, and plain old common sense:</p>

<p>I implore you, for the sake of your children, to leave your state. Seek refuge from those among your neighbors who would so blight the wonder of democracy.</p>

<p><em>You</em> are the 39%, who refused to institutionalize hate, to legalize discrimination, to dress up ignorance in the guise of religion, or to use family as a pretext for subjugating a minority. Be proud.</p>
