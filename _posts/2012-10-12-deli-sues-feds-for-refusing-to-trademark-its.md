<a href='http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20121012_Deli_says_its_Minnesota_beef_sets_it_apart_as__Philadelphia_s_Cheesesteak_.html'>Deli sues feds for refusing to trademark its 'Philadelphia's Cheesesteak'</a><div class="link_description"><p>Michael Hinkelman, writing at the <em>Philadelphia Daily News</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Campo&#8217;s claims in its civil complaint that its sandwich is &#8220;so superlative&#8221; and &#8220;gloriously gluttonous&#8221; that only it could be called &#8220;Philadelphia&#8217;s Cheesesteak.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fellow doesn&#8217;t have a chance in hell, but it&#8217;s a fun story. &#8220;Philadelphia&#8217;s Cheesesteak&#8221; is sufficiently similar to previous marks (mentioned in the article) and sufficiently generic with regard to geography (also mentioned in the article) that rejection of the mark is valid on its face. Federal court isn&#8217;t going to decide it differently.</p>

<p>In fact, pursuing the issue may alert the holders of the previously-granted similar marks and lead to infringement suits against Campos. I assume he and his attorney have discussed that possibility, but that would certainly be a frustrating turn of events for the steak-slinger.</p></div>
