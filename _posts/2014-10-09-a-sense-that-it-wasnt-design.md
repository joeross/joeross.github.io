<a href='http://www.vogue.com/1415025/apple-design-genius-jonathan-ive'>A sense that it wasn’t design</a><div class="link_description"><p>Robert Sullivan has such a good interview with Jony Ive over at <em>Vogue</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In other words, the secret weapon of the most sought-after personal-electronics company in the world is a very nice guy from Northeast London who has a soft spot for woodworking and the sense that designers ought to keep their design talents backstage where they can do the most good. “There’s an odd irony here,” he observes. “I think our goal is that you would have a sense that it wasn’t design.”

<p>I’m not sure the Apple Watch is for me because I haven’t had the chance to hold one yet. But the passion and sincerity Ive exudes for his work compels me to at least check it out.</p></div>
