<a href='http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50396758#.UOwwVRe04jE'>California Scout group recommends openly gay member for Eagle</a><div class="link_description"><p>The Scouts&#8217; central authority is unlikely to honor the recommendation because of their culture of fear and hate toward LGBTQ people. And the law may be on Boy Scouts of America&#8217;s side, at least for now, but history is not. Future generations will look back on private organizations who discriminated based on sexual orientation, however lawfully, with disgust.</p></div>
