<a href='http://allthingsd.com/20130108/aereo-raises-38-million-to-take-its-cord-cutting-service-to-22-more-cities/?mod=atdtweet'>Aereo in Philly before year's end</a><div class="link_description"><p>I&#8217;m looking forward to this: Peter Kafka reports at <em>All Things D</em> that <a href="https://aereo.com/" target="_blank">Aereo</a> is expanding this year, and Philadelphia is on their list. Cable and television companies should have been on this themselves, and they&#8217;re missing out by focusing on a court battle they&#8217;re <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/07/11/diller-and-aereo-win-first-round-injunction-denied/" target="_blank">not guaranteed to win</a>. Innovation, while it may cost as much as litigation, at least results in a marketable product.</p>

<p>You can pre-register for Philly or any of the twenty-one other cities they&#8217;re coming to in 2013&#160;<a href="https://aereo.com/preregister" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>
