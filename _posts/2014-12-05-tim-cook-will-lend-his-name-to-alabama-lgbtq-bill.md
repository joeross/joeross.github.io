<a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/04/us-usa-alabama-apple-ceo-idUSKCN0JI07I20141204'>Tim Cook will lend his name to Alabama LGBTQ bill</a><div class="link_description"><p>Apple initially expressed corporate reluctance, but Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell later told Pamela Todd, Alabama&#8217;s only openly gay lawmaker, that CEO Tim Cook &#8220;would be delighted&#8221; to have a bill named after him which would protect LGBTQ Alabama state employees from discrimination.</p>

<p>Cook said when he came out publicly in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay" target="_blank">an essay for Bloomberg Businessweek</a> that while he doesn&#8217;t usually like to draw attention to himself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time, I believe deeply in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, who said: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’ ” I often challenge myself with that question, and I’ve come to realize that my desire for personal privacy has been holding me back from doing something more important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may seem like letting someone name a law after you isn&#8217;t that profound, but it is. The law will get national and even international attention primarily because of Tim Cook&#8217;s name. Without it, the law would have been written about by Alabama press and journalists in surrounding states, and would have been covered by LGBTQ publications.</p>

<p>But this small thing Mr. Cook can do, this simple thing, lends a volume to Pamela Todd&#8217;s proposal it may otherwise have lacked. And it&#8217;s already worked: I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read a single word about Alabama state law of any kind, despite graduating from law school, becoming a licensed attorney and frequently writing about law in general and LGBTQ legal developments in particular.</p></div>
