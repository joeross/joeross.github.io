<a href='http://www.engadget.com/2013/07/15/all-good-things/'>Tim Stevens is no longer editor-in-chief at Engadget</a><div class="link_description"><p>Two years is a good run, and the site looks and reads far better than it did before his reign, but Tim Stevens&#8217; exit from his role as editor-in-chief at Aol property <em>Engadget</em> is bad sign for the site and it&#8217;s owner.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s never a good sign, in business or blogging (and especially when your product is a hybrid), when a leadership role is vacated before a replacement is appointed.</p></div>
