<a href='http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2014/02/how-long-can-cop-keep-you-pulled-over-after-traffic-stop-no-ones-sure/8293/'>What is the maximum constitutional duration of a traffic stop?</a><div class="link_description"><p>The answer is, perhaps unsuprisingly, not clear. But while too few people know you donâ€™t have to allow a vehicle search, the power differential during a traffic stop probably overrides abstract constitutional notions.</p>

<p>As the article says, be polite and minimize conversation. Police are used to the power differential and they are as comfortable with it as you are uncomfortable. They don&#8217;t want to hear about your constitutional law class or how you read an article in <em>The Atlantic</em> about traffic stops.</p></div>
