<a href='http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/01/u-s-house-open-data-open-government.html'>More House of Representatives data available in XML</a><div class="link_description"><p><em>O&#8217;Reilly</em>'s Alex Howard reports that both House floor summaries and bulk downloads of all House legislation are now available in XML. It doesn't mean <em>everything</em> Congress does is available yet, but it&#8217;s a great progression.</p>

<p>I really hope some enterprising developers make something cool with the newly-available data streams, and future offerings as well. I propose an app that provides push notifications when keywords of your choice are mentioned on the House floor.</p></div>
