<p><em>This site is supposed to be me talking about the law and technology, but I have some shameless self promotion to do, so I&#8217;m deviating from the usual subject matter this week.</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;shameless_self_promotion&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I recently started a new Tumblr called, creatively, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com" target="_blank"><em>Fiction by Joe Ross</em></a>. I&#8217;m posting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction" target="_blank">flash fiction</a> there, because I love to write it and it&#8217;s the best I can do length-wise until I finish my JD in December (a semester early, if you&#8217;re counting, which I am &#8230; <em>pats self on back</em>). It&#8217;s going to be mostly but not <em>all</em> science fiction, so if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing, please check it out and tell me what you think.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>I have been writing fiction since, probably, ever. My first short story was a survival tale about a man&#8217;s struggle in the wilderness. Alas, I can&#8217;t find it, but I wrote it in high school and I remember being <em>super</em> proud of it. Survival? Wilderness? Sold!</p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote another story in college, call <em>Three Days</em>, which you can get for free <a href="http://leanpub.com/threedays" target="_blank">in eBook format at Leanpub</a>. Did I mention that it&#8217;s <em>free</em>? Go get it. It has an epidemic, love, psychiatry, and time travel.</p>

<p>I know, genius.</p>

<p>Oh, and <strong>it&#8217;s okay to tell me you don&#8217;t like stuff</strong>. You get extra points for being as polite about it as Scott, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time#comment-583582813" target="_blank">my first commenter</a>, was, but what I really want is to know <em>why</em> you didn&#8217;t like it. Of course, it won&#8217;t kill me to hear from you even if you <em>did</em> like it, but constructive criticism is wonderful.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I&#8217;m one of those obnoxious people who doesn&#8217;t <em>mind</em> telling you I&#8217;m in law school, and working full time, and kind of a big deal because of all that. The bottom line is, though, that I never have much time to write, the little time I <em>do</em> have I use mostly to write about tech news and law stuff, and I have <em>no</em> time at all to edit. So I&#8217;ve been hoarding all these little scenes of mine, sometimes for years. That hoarding, for better or worse, has come to an end.</p>

<p>As of the publication of this post, I&#8217;ve already put up two scenes, <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time" target="_blank"><em>Carnival Time</em></a> and <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/27079728829/the-deaths-of-dolly-dignan" target="_blank"><em>The Deaths of Dolly Dignan</em></a>. I bet you&#8217;ll like at least <em>one</em> of them, at least a <em>little</em> bit.</p>

<p>And, even if you don&#8217;t, and I become a famous author one day, you&#8217;ll be one of the <em>cool</em> kids who read my stuff long before I was on the bestsellers list. People make fun of people like that but admit it, the truth is that we all <em>love</em> having the chance to <em>be</em> one of them.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s that very chance that I&#8217;m offering you today, for the future. Or something. <a href="http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com" target="_blank">So here&#8217;s the link, one more time</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m done.</p>
