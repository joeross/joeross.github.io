<a href='http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323419104578376042379430724-lMyQjAxMTAzMDMwMTEzNDEyWj.html'>China is very serious about cyberespionage</a><div class="link_description"><p>Google apologists like myself often answer concerns that the search-and-advertising giant can scan your email with something like &#8220;yes, but they&#8217;re doing it with robots and scrubbing it clean of all identifying information.&#8221;</p>

<p>China, however, is not so concerned with your privacy or its own image. In fact, monitoring otherwise-harmless civilians probably proves valuable to the renegade nation by illustrating the best means of tricking US netizens into installing backdoor viruses on their systems.</p>

<p>The most important point this article makes, in my view, is that China is playing the long game on cyberespionage efforts. As David Feith reports in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> piece linked to above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence of China&#8217;s thinking about cyber warfare is the concept of shi, he says, first introduced in Sun Tzu&#8217;s &#8220;The Art of War&#8221; about 2,500 years ago. The concept&#8217;s English translation is debated, but Mr. Thomas subscribes to the rendering of Chinese Gen. Tao Hanzhang, who defines shi as &#8220;the strategically advantageous posture before a battle.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#8217;re not going to take down any infrastructure any time soon, but if and when they want to, their current efforts will probably go a long way to helping them learn how to do it.</p>

<p>This stuff is not just a headline: it&#8217;s been happening for some time, is still happening, and is likely only to increase. Mr. Feith&#8217;s article at the <em>Journal</em> is well worth reading.</p></div>
