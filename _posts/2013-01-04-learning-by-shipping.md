<a href='http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2013/01/03/hello-world/'>Learning by Shipping</a><div class="link_description"><p>Former Windows executive Steven Sinofsky, explaining the name of his new blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The title comes from something impressed upon me early in my career, which is that learning as an engineer comes from the process of starting, then finishing, and iterating on productsâ€“getting products to market and putting the broad feedback loop to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny, that&#8217;s why <em>I</em> picked <em>this</em> website&#8217;s name. Great minds&#8230; Although I would have called it &#8220;Learn by Shipping.&#8221; That -ing after &#8220;learn&#8221; is bugging me.</p>

<p>Still bugging me.</p></div>
