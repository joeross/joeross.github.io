<a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/01/15/marc-andreessen-twitter/'>Who cares if I think this link leads to a silly blog post at Forbes.com?</a><div class="link_description"><p>No one. Least of all I.</p>

<p>I just wrote too many words about why I think the post I link to above isn&#8217;t worth the bandwidth it&#8217;s transmitted over, but I was being tired and petty and shitting on the good-natured opinion of someone more successful than I, so I deleted those words.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m embarrassed I wrote the first version of this note, but I give myself a few points for having published this far more self-aware and candid revision.</p></div>
