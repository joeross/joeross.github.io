<a href='http://overanalyze.net/links/2012/06/kindle-library-bulk-delete/'>Kindle Library Bulk Delete</a><div class="link_description"><p>I want to thank Mr. Nathaniel Robertson for pointing people in need of cleaning up their Kindle archive to this bookmarklet that allows you to bulk-delete entire pages of Kindle Library content. Many thanks to the person behind Japanese blog <a href="http://netbuffalo.doorblog.jp/archives/4036341.html" target="_blank"><em>Net Buffalo</em></a> for solving this problem.</p>

<p>I, like them, needed to get rid of months of Instapaper cruft. This bookmarklet did the trick. Instapaper&#8217;s Kindle integration is wonderful, but I wish Amazon would let us auto-delete recurring content.</p></div>
