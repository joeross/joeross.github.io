[The Amazon Noncompete Clause](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8280309/amazon-warehouse-jobs-exclusive-noncompete-contracts)

Here it is, in all its overbroad glory:

> During employment and for 18 months after the Separation Date, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, whether on Employeeâ€™s own behalf or on behalf of any other entity (for example, as an employee, agent, partner, or consultant), engage in or support the development, manufacture, marketing, or sale of any product or service that competes or is intended to compete with any product or service sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon (or intended to be sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon in the future) that Employee worked on or supported, or about which Employee obtained or received Confidential Information.

Whew. All that legalese is translatable into American English as:

> You can't work in another warehosue that, you know, contains stuff people buy, with money, that is, um, anywhere, pretty much in the world. 

The linked report by *The Verge* resulted in a much-needed [revision to the policy](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-removes-non-compete-clause-for-hourly-workers-2015-3), but it's a powerful reminder that behind all the random stuff we order online are people who are sometimes commoditized and mistreated by their employers.
