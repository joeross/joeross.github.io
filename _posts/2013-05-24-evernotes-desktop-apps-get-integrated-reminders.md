<a href='http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/05/23/evernote-reminders-are-here-on-mac-ios-and-web-2/'>Evernote's desktop apps get integrated reminders and a task list, no love for mobile yet</a><div class="link_description"><p>Evernote&#8217;s reminders are great news, and <a href="http://joeross.me/post/42849599646/evernote-ceo-hints-at-future-task-management" target="_blank">something I&#8217;ve been waiting for since at least February</a>, but here&#8217;s all that matters to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have big plans to expand the functionality, and to bring it to more platforms in the very (very) near future.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to get this on mobile. I&#8217;ve long hoped that some day Evernote would become the one-app-to-rule-them-all for me. I already use it as a data archive, storage for manuals, occasional journal, research tool, and songwriting management tool. True, cross-platform task management would supercharge the service for me, and may even end my Any.do versus Wunderlist <a href="http://joeross.me/post/42849599646/evernote-ceo-hints-at-future-task-management#fn:p42849599646-1" target="_blank">problem</a>.</p>

<p>In related news, Wunderlist has <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/wunderlist-for-the-web" target="_blank">added hashtag support </a>in its web incarnation, and so far I&#8217;m actually finding it&#8217;s very useful.</p></div>
