<a href='http://www.geekadelphia.com/2014/09/17/attend-the-outbeat-jazz-festival-kickoff-reception-william-way-community-center-on-september-18th/'>OutBeat, America's First Queer Jazz Festival</a><div class="link_description"><p>I don&#8217;t usually write about events here, but since I wrote the article to which I link above, I thought it appropriate to share. I had several great conversations with Chris Bartlett, Executive Director of the William Way Community Center in Philadelphia, about OutBeat in writing the article. I&#8217;ll publish a Q&amp;A with him next month, also at Geekadelphia.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re gay, bisexual, straight or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroflexibility" target="_blank">heteroflexible</a>, and even if you don&#8217;t like jazz ( or don&#8217;t know yet that you <em>do</em> like jazz), the four-day festival is going to be fun and informative. With any luck, I&#8217;ll be able to stop by.</p></div>
