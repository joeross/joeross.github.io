<a href='http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/'>The systemic failure of modern hiring practices</a><div class="link_description"><p>Laurie Voss, in a piece about technical hiring that is easily applied to the legal field and hiring more generally, on asking applicants questions to which they almost certainly don&#8217;t know the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The weakest candidates will try to waffle or make wild guesses. This is a terrible sign, firstly because it never works, and secondly because they thought that it would. [ &#8230;  ] Strong candidates say “I don’t know” as soon as they hit their limit, and may start asking questions. The very strongest candidates say “but if I had to guess” and then attempt to extrapolate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup. And what&#8217;s more, most interviewers or hiring managers who ask such counterproductive questions are actually <em>looking</em> for the waffles and the wild guesses. They invariably want to see someone who can obfuscate without sacrificing an air of omniscience.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an astounding feat of self-sabotage, and it makes it difficult for the truly intelligent among us (like myself, all arrogance aside&#8230;) to make an impression among the din of bloviating thought-sheep.</p></div>
