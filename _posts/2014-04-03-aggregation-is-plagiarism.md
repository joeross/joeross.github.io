<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but aggregate (though not plagiarize) <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/03/31/aggregation-is-plagiarism/" target="_blank">this link</a> Jim Dalrymple aggregated to <a href="http://www.joewilcox.com/2014/03/28/aggregation-is-plagiarism/" target="_blank">a post by a Mr. Joe Wilcox</a> about how aggregation is, well, plagiarism.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>It&#8217;s true, now that you&#8217;ve read this you don&#8217;t need to read the original to know what it&#8217;s about. <em>However</em>, my guess is you&#8217;ll miss out on the personal reasons and nuanced perspective Mr. Wilcox offers if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> go and read his post.</p>

<p>I certainly agree with his position, not an uncommon one, that word-for-word copies or close paraphrases are plagiarism plain and simple. But I would term that behavior, well, plagiarism. Aggregation, done right, will collect interesting material to which the collector wants to point his own readers, adding context or perspective or opinion lacking in the original.</p>

<p>John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a> is a great example of that: it&#8217;s comprised almost entirely of links to the work of others, often including quotes from the linked-to article. But it&#8217;s as far from plagiarism as you can get. People read Gruber&#8217;s site specifically for his opinion on the news of the day. Most of his readers probably find the newsy bits elsewhere, be it on Twitter or another news site. But Gruber&#8217;s take adds value, and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re there.</p>

<p>I like to think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing here, but I suppose only readers like you can decide that.</p></div>
