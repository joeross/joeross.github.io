<p><a href="http://drewb.org/post/59337353102/media-analysis-measles-outbreak-traced-to-anti-vaccine" class="tumblr_blog" target="_blank">dbreunig</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>An astounding story that should be part of the national conversation regarding vaccines. Seems straight forward.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/23/texas-measles-outbreak/2693945/" target="_blank">USA Today</a> doesn’t mention the church’s stance on vaccines until the <em>13th paragraph</em>. <a href="http://gawker.com/texas-measles-outbreak-traced-to-anti-vaccine-megachurc-1197363514" target="_blank">Gawker</a>, on the other hand, essentially reblogs the USA Today piece but moves the pastor’s anti-vaccine stance to the headline.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great catch by Drew Breunig here. I don&#8217;t believe in god and I&#8217;m not religious, but respect that many do and are.</p>

<p>However, run as fast as you can from any religious leader who claims vaccines are dangerous.</p>

<p>When religion and science contradict one another, particularly on matters of health and public safety, religion must, without exception or hesitation, be set aside.</p>

<p>This should not be difficult for religious people to accept: Any rational god would insist on that anyway.</p>
