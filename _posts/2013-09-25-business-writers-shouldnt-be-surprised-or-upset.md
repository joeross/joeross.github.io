<a href='http://www.thewrap.com/ibt-medias-dress-code-covers-up-more-serious-issues/'>Business writers shouldn't be surprised or upset about having to dress up for work</a><div class="link_description"><p>Sara Morrison of The Wrap:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>The [New York branch of the Newspaper G]uild, which represents all Newsweek employees, says IBT is violating federal law by prohibiting employees from discussing their work conditions or criticizing their employer.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Okay, that&#8217;s a problem if it&#8217;s true, since federal law prohibits that behavior by an employer. But the other bit is what prompted me to write a quick post:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>The report [that jeans and other casual wardrobe choices are prohibited at IBT Media] made waves among journalists, but the outcry might have been premature. Neither outlet that reported on the handbook apparently made the effort to ask IBT employees if it was actually enforced.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not enforced.</p>

<p><span>Even if it were enforced, it&#8217;s nothing for serious journalists to complain about. I&#8217;m the digital editor at a business journal, <a href="http://njbiz.com" target="_blank">NJBIZ</a>, whose parent company requires employees at all of its publications to dress business-appropriate. That means no jeans, real shoes, and yes, even a tie.</span></p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m new to the journalism world, and I worked in a tie-requiring job for five years before I landed at my current gig, so the professional attire isn&#8217;t a new game for me. I am told it&#8217;s a little strange to make a reporter wear a tie, but I think there are circumstances in which a journalist just shouldn&#8217;t be surprised at the mandate.</p>

<p>For example, working at a business journal, or the International <strong>Business</strong> Times, one is likely to encounter sources, readers and advertisers any day of the week, whether in the course of one&#8217;s own work or as a result of their colleagues&#8217; work.</p>

<p>To be clear, IBT employees weren&#8217;t complaining, as they told The Wrap the requirements aren&#8217;t even enforced. Apparently, some people were not pleased, though, with the stringent dress code. I think that&#8217;s crap.</p>

<p>I can see a music journalist getting annoyed about wearing a tie, but business writers should expect to dress the part.</p></div>
