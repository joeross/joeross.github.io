[Drone regulation, firefighting and basic decency](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/us/california-freeway-fire/index.html)

Michael Martinez, Paul Vercammen and Ben Brumfield report at *CNN*:

> Five such "unmanned aircraft systems" prevented California firefighters from dispatching helicopters with water buckets for up to 20 minutes over a wildfire that roared Friday onto a Los Angeles area freeway that leads to Las Vegas. 

This is an inappropriate use of drones, wholly lacking in basic decency. It's not impossible, or even implausible, that a drone-related delay will some day result in the destruction of one or more homes or even get someone burned to death.

It's not far removed from scumbaggery like the Ohio jackass who [filmed the aftermath of a fatal car accident](http://mashable.com/2015/07/17/ohio-car-crash-video-charges/) instead of helping the victims. Drone enthusiasts who want to minimize regulation already have a tough road ahead, so they would be wise to engage in some self-regulation. 

Connecticut lawyer and commercial drone lobbyist Peter Sachs created the Drone Pilots Association to advocate for more commercial drone use. There is even video [on his website](http://dronelawjournal.com/about-peter-sachs/) of his using a drone to assist the volunteer fire department he works with. 

The difference between sachs and the California morons is that Sachs *offered* his drone to the department *for its use* in battling a blaze. So it's clear that drones can be a useful tool in fighting fires, they just shouldn't be used for fire tourism when firefighters, homes and civilians are potentially in danger.
