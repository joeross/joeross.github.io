<p>Jon Russell, writing at <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wang said, via Twitter, that the company was unable to discuss the specifics of the incident because “we don’t comment on individual accounts.” That position was echoed in a statement that Twitter provided to the BBC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s unacceptable. It&#8217;s one thing to give the silent treatment to feature requests and &#8220;first world problem&#8221; complaints. But it&#8217;s another thing entirely when someone is being deluged with threats and then sees <em>their own account</em> suspended when they reach out about it.</p>

<p>Twitter is lucky it has built up so much goodwill among users and the press, because it burned much of it off with this serious misstep.</p></div>
