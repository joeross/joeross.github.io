<a href='http://thebrief.io/wcit/'>The World Conference on International Communications</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is important, and Richard Dunlop-Walters&#8217;s <em>The Brief</em> has a great, ongoing summary of the issue and the news coming out of the World Conference on International Communications. It may seem dry at first, but this stuff could have far-reaching effects on privacy and internet governance, so it&#8217;s worth at least a quick glance.</p></div>
