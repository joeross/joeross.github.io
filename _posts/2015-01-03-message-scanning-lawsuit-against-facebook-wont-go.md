<a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/suit-over-facebooks-practice-of-scanning-users-messages-to-go-forward/'>Message scanning lawsuit against Facebook won't go away</a><div class="link_description"><p>John Timmer reports at <em>Ars Technica</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The court responded to this request by pursuing an extraordinarily rare course of action: it read Facebook’s entire terms of service. And, in this case, their vague language—typically used to provide broad immunity—became a liability: “[the document] does not establish that users consented to the scanning of their messages for advertising purposes, and in fact, makes no mention of ‘messages’ whatsoever.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be specific with those Terms of Service. <em>Really</em> specific.</p></div>
