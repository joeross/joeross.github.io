<a href='http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79559.html?hp=l6'>FTC OKs Facebook’s privacy settlement</a><div class="link_description"><p>Tony Romm, writing at Politico:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The order means Facebook must now obtain consent before sharing a user’s information with advertisers or others in a way that differs from their current privacy settings, and it bars Facebook from again misrepresenting its privacy and security practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This settlement will be in place for twenty years. Will Facebook still be here in twenty years?</p></div>
