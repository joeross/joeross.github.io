<blockquote>
  <p>The targeting would hypothetically enable Coca-Cola to target to teenagers who&#8217;ve bought soda in the last month, or Pampers to show ads to North Carolina residents who&#8217;ve recently bought baby products, since Facebook&#8217;s own array of demographic and interest-based targeting options can be added to further refine audience segments. But adoption will be contingent on acceptance by corporate legal departments wary of becoming embroiled in a consumer privacy scare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not something I would rush into if I was one of those &#8220;corporate legal departments.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I have some conspiracy theory about Facebook, or those data banks. I don&#8217;t. We give data to those data banks willingly when we use those discount cards. Shame on us for not reading the fine print.</p>

<p>And Facebook? They&#8217;re the same: the fact that nothing private is guaranteed to stay that way on the internet is common knowledge these days, and those who don&#8217;t know <em>should know</em>.</p>

<p>What would worry me as in-house counsel is what hackers will find when they inevitably get their hands on some of this data. In other words, Facebook and data banks are the devils we know. I would keep clients out of this plan because of the devils we <em>don&#8217;t</em> know.</p></div>
