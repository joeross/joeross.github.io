<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/who-needs-original-content-ouya-to-launch-with-nintendo-64-snes-and-nes-emulation-support/'>OUYA and Emulation</a><div class="link_description"><p>Darrell Etherington, reporting at <em>TechCrunch</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OUYA forum admin and owner Ed Krassenstein said in a post on his site that EMUya, a NES emulator, has been submitted to OUYA for review and should definitely be available at launch, and a couple of SNES emulation options are confirmed, including the SuperGNES and the Mupen64Plus Nintendo 64 emulators. The Mupen64Plus project is also said to be available at launch, with the developer behind it posting that it has already been approved by OUYA for inclusion in the official store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OUYA would do well to backtrack on this, and fast. If they mean to make themselves a legitimate part of the console landscape, the encouragement of unlicensed emulation, which amounts to copyright infringement, is not the way to go.</p></div>
