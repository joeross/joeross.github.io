<p>From the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20120805c.html" target="_blank">NASA press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Seven Minutes of Terror has turned into the Seven Minutes of Triumph,&#8221; said NASA Associate Administrator for Science John Grunsfeld. &#8220;My immense joy in the success of this mission is matched only by overwhelming pride I feel for the women and men of the mission&#8217;s team.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feeling I had just <em>reading</em> about this at 1:30 a.m. is nothing compared to the joy of those working on this project. But it was definitely a strange but wonderful sense of <em>personal</em> triumph, like &#8220;I&#8217;m a human, and humans did this amazing thing, and that is awesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wish it didn&#8217;t look trite as I typed the words, but it&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>There was something stranger in that feeling, too, if no less wonderful: it was a sense of <em>patriotism</em>. I&#8217;m a patriotic person, despite harboring a certain cynicism about modern American politics. But my Curiosity Rover patriotism is a patriotism I rarely feel, and it&#8217;s what I always imagined people felt when we landed on the moon, and when they watched numerous other early launches by NASA.</p>

<p>Humanity will go farther, on Earth and in space, if well-meaning nations work together. But there is something so moving about watching a chronically underfunded national agency, whose importance to our past, present, and future is always underestimated, put almost two-thousand pounds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory" target="_blank">advanced technology</a> on <em>another planet</em>.</p>

<p>And the best part? This is really just the <em>beginning</em> of the mission.</p>
