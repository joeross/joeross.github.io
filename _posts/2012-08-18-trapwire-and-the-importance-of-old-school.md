<p>RT (<em>Russia Today</em>) <a href="http://rt.com/usa/news/stratfor-trapwire-abraxas-wikileaks-313/" target="_blank">reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The employee roster at Arbaxas reads like a who&#8217;s who of agents once with the Pentagon, CIA and other government entities according to their public LinkedIn profiles, and the corporation&#8217;s ties are assumed to go deeper than even documented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Abraxas" allegedly maintains and operates a network of encrypted surveillance cameras used for sophisticated facial recognition in antiterrorism efforts.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know much about RT, but <em>The Economist</em> <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2010/07/russia_today_goes_mad" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t seem too keen on them</a>. The <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em> has <a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/what_is_russia_today.php" target="_blank">a great longform piece on RT</a> that, admittedly, I haven&#8217;t read yet.</p>

<p>And while I&#8217;m not a journalist, I&#8217;m a little concerned that many journalists seem to be running with this story, or at least giving it the credibility of an unqualified mention. <em>Russia Today</em> seems to lack the same credibility we grant to <em>The New York Times</em> and its ilk, but still the TrapWire story ascends. It has <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/120811/p6#a120811p6" target="_blank">hit Techmeme</a>, but maybe it should be on <a href="http://mediagazer.com/" target="_blank">Mediagazer</a>. The alleged surveillance program, called &#8220;TrapWire&#8221; and evidenced in <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/" target="_blank">Stratfor</a> emails released by Wikileaks, might be 100% real. But I have seen many headlines and little if any follow-up reporting or fact-checking of any kind.</p>

<p>For example, no one has mentioned the very public website <a href="http://www.trapwire.com/" target="_blank">TrapWire.com</a>, which looks on the surface to be very similar to the &#8220;top secret&#8221; program described in the Straftor emails. Maybe someone has and I missed it, if so, I&#8217;m sorry and please let me know. If it isn&#8217;t related to the top secret program, I&#8217;m sorry, and let me know that, too. The confirmation on this example is illustrative of the journalism we need in following up on this leak.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m worried about the state, and the future, of journalism in the Age of Leaks. Leaks are great as a place to start digging. But they&#8217;re not, or shouldn&#8217;t be, a place to begin and end an article. I hope a respectable news organization holds off on grabbing for pageviews and publishes an article in a week or two weeks or a month, full of independent investigation and research, that either confirms or debunks TrapWire. That&#8217;s the kind of journalism the network world has enabled, and the kind we deserve.</p>
