[Dying in New Jersey is expensive](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/10/lawmakers-hope-to-bury-death-tax-in-nj/23194471/)

The good news, though, is that the state is considering changes to the estate and inheritance taxes, which together "doulbe dip" into your estate when you die. 

The estate tax applies only to estates worth $675,000 or more, so many of us (me, at least) will scoff and say we *wish* we had enough dough for it to apply to *us*. 

But the wealthy folks to whom it *does* apply have a great incentive to get out of New Jersey before they die, taking substantial amounts of income tax, not to mention money that would otherwise be generally returned to the state's economy, with them.
