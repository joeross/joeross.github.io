["Happy birthday" lawsuit takes a(n unexpectedly interesting) turn](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/happy-birthday-lawsuit-smoking-gun-811144)

Did you know copyright lawyers have waged a legal battle over 'Happy Birthday' for a long time? They have, and, somehow, it recently got interesting. 

> If this proposition is accepted by the judge, Warner/Chappell may lose out on a cash cow that is reported to reap $2 million a year in revenue. Filmmakers like the named plaintiffs — and others who have forked over as much as six figures to license — would no longer have to pay a penny to feature "Happy Birthday" in motion pictures and television shows. 

If the copyright the company has been using for years to charge people licensing fees is invalidated, we may see a whole lot of lawsuits aimed at the would-be copyright holders to recoup those licensing fees.
