<a href='http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/08/net-us-computerfraud-law-idINBRE8771BK20120808'>U.S. will not challenge computer fraud case to high court</a><div class="link_description"><p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030" target="_blank">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> prohibits, among other things, accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization. Employers have been known to use it against employees where the latter has used a company database to poach clients for a new venture or otherwise used proprietary company information for personal benefit and to the employer’s detriment.</p>

<p>The Reuters article correctly points out that many jurists look at such issues as employer/employee matters undeserving of criminal prosecution, at least to the extent that they don’t violate other laws pertaining to trade secrets, securities law, and other potentially-applicable law.</p>

<p>I agree: an employee’s exceeding authorized access to further goals contrary to the company’s interests, unless the information retrieved is properly considered a trade secret or otherwise is protected, should be a firing offense but not a prosecuting one.</p></div>
