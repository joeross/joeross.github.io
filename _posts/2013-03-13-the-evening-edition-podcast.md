<a href='http://www.muleradio.net/eveningedition/'>The Evening Edition Podcast</a><div class="link_description"><p><a href="http://evening-edition.com/" target="_blank"><em>Evening Edition</em></a> is a wonderful way to catch up on news that doesn&#8217;t include a Kardashian or an Apple rumor. Now, they offer a five-minute daily podcast featuring the stories of the day. I tried reading <em>Evening Edition</em> via their <a href="http://eepurl.com/qvveL" target="_blank">email newsletter</a>, RSS, and the website itself, but I miss a day or two each week. I have found the podcast much easier to fit into a hectic schedule. I highly recommend it.</p></div>
