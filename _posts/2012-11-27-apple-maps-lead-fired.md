<a href='http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-27/apple-said-to-fire-maps-manager-after-flaws-hurt-iphone-5-debut'>Apple Maps lead fired</a><div class="link_description"><p>Richard Williamson is his name, and shipping a less-than-perfect mapping application on the iPhone 5&#160;<em>was</em> his game, until, as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Adam Satariano reports, Senior Vice President Eddy Cue fired him.</p>

<p>As an aside, I really like that <em>Bloomberg</em> lists both the reporter&#8217;s and the editor&#8217;s name and email address at the bottom of stories. More publications should do that.</p></div>
