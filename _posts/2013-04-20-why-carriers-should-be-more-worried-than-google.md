<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/18/4240222/facebook-rolls-out-free-voice-calling-for-android-users-in-the-us'>Why carriers should be more worried than Google about Facebook Home</a><div class="link_description"><p>Ellis Hamburger, writing at <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mir­ror­ing its roll­out of free VoIP call­ing for iOS, Face­book has updat­ed its Mes­sen­ger app for Android to allow free call­ing for users in the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is Facebook’s true sleight of hand: everyone is looking at Home and how they’re taking over the launcher and Android. Meanwhile they’re backdooring this VoIP technology that lets you call people using only wifi.</p>

<p>Facebook is asserting its primacy in the minds of millions of mobile users not only to dominate Android, but to put itself in a solid position to dominate carriers as well. Simple, user-friendly VoIP: one of the biggest and potentially most profound opportunities Google ever missed with Android.</p></div>
