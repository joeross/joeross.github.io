[NASA, Verizon developing tech to track drones via cell towers](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/03/verizon-nasa-drones-cellphone-towers)

Mark Harris reports at *The Guardian*:

> That $500,000 project is now underway at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in the heart of Silicon Valley. Nasa is planning the first tests of an air traffic control system for drones there this summer, with Verizon scheduled to introduce a concept for using cell coverage for data, navigation, surveillance and tracking of drones by 2017. The phone company hopes to finalise its technology by 2019.

This is fascinating to me because the documents obtained by *The Guardian* describe the purpose of the partnership as to “jointly explore if cell towers and communications could possibly support Unmannned Aerial Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) for communications and surveillance of UAS *at low altitudes*” (emphasis added).

NASA typically focuses on altitudes so high they're, well, in *space*, so why are they involved with developing low-altitutde drone tracking technology?

I want to note that I'm not necessarily opposed to *someone* in the government being able to keep track of all the drones that will inevitably be zipping around. I'm just not sure why NASA is involved, and I wonder whether their choice of Verizon as a partner serves as a tacit confirmation of that cellular network's claims of coverage supremacy over its competitors.
