<a href='http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-11803-brazilian-newspapers-leave-google-news-en-masse'>Brazilian newspapers leave Google News en masse</a><div class="link_description"><p>Carlos Fernando Lindenberg Neto, president of Brazil&#8217;s National Association of Newspapers, on his association&#8217;s withdraw from Google News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Newsâ€™ presence in the Brazilian market is small. We believe (the loss of traffic) is an acceptable price to protect our content and brands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The linked article, by Isabela Fraga at the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas blog, offers good background on the issue.</p>

<p>I never go to Google News without clicking on at least three stories I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise encountered. Maybe I&#8217;m the exception and not the rule. But if Google News&#8217; presence is really that small, isn&#8217;t the potential or actual harm they claim necessarily small as well?</p>

<p>This decision looks petty and short-sighted, particularly in light of <em>Newsweek</em>'s <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/18/a-turn-of-the-page-for-newsweek.html" target="_blank">recent announcement</a>.</p></div>
