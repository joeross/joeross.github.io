<a href='http://jimromenesko.com/2012/08/08/philadelphia-newspapers-ceos-message-to-employees/'>Philadelphia newspapers CEO’s message to employees</a><div class="link_description"><p>Jim Romenesko, quoting the letter from Bob Hall, CEO at Interstate General Media, which owns Philly’s major papers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We must produce products that reflect the needs of our readers, viewers, advertisers and future prospective customers. This is essential if we are to increase the total audience that we reach and to provide the consumer superior content, whenever, however (multi-products), and in whatever format desired. It is becoming even more important to be relevant, useful and timely via the applications that are utilized by our customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Hall means what he says, and is well-informed, he’ll approach people like the folks who run <a href="http://technicallymedia.com/" target="_blank">Technically Media</a>—people who are connected to what 21st-century journalism is shaping up to be.</p>
