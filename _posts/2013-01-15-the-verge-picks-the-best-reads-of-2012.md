<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/28/3809104/best-internet-writing-2012'>The Verge picks the best reads of 2012</a><div class="link_description"><p>This is a great list, and includes only a few that missed, which probably means I read too much about tech. But what I particularly like about it is that most of the stories would appeal in one way or another to even to &#8220;normals&#8221;who don&#8217;t obsessively follow the technology industry.</p></div>
