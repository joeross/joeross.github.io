<a href='http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2014/04/plagiarism-in-legal-briefs.html'>Plagiarism in Legal Briefs</a><div class="link_description"><p>Gerard Magliocca, writing at Concurring Opinions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I cited [someone else&#8217;s] brief in an attempt to fairly attribute the source when I made the same point, then Iâ€™d look like an uncreative doofus.  If I did not cite the brief, though, then that would (or could) be plagiarism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be an interesting bit of research to determine how many sentences are copied without attribution from the briefs of other attorneys. I suspect it happens often.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s uncreative to cite another lawyer&#8217;s brief. Legal writing is a game of cites. If anything, an uncited thought may raise questions rather than project creativity.</p>

<p>The real creativity in legal advocacy, as far as I have learned in law school, working as a litigation paralegal and reading far too much legal writing for &#8220;pleasure,&#8221; is in the optimal juxtaposition, <em>creatively</em>, of the cited facts and the thoughts of your forbears.</p>

<p>No one wants to see a newly minted physics professor work out the proof for E = MC2. The formula is there as a shortcut so others can build, creatively, upon the concepts for which it provides a shorthand.</p>

<p>After all, what judge prefers your lengthy version of an angle you could just as easily refer to with a short quote and a cite to a previous brief?</p>

<p>Whatever you think of this, a quick search turned up a bit of further reading on the issue and I&#8217;ve included a few links below. The question certainly isn&#8217;t settled, so I&#8217;m as interested as Mr. Magliocca in hearing other opinions.</p>
