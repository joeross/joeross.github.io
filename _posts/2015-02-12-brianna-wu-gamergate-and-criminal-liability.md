<a href='http://www.bustle.com/articles/63466-im-brianna-wu-and-im-risking-my-life-standing-up-to-gamergate'>Brianna Wu, #gamergate and criminal liability</a><div class="link_description"><p>I&#8217;m not licensed to practice law in Massachusetts (though I <em>am</em> licensed in New Jersey and Pennsylvania), where game developer and #gamergate target Brianna Wu (<a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">@spacekatgal</a>) and her tormentor both live, so I&#8217;m speaking solely as a gamer and an ally of women, minorities, the LGBTQ community and anyone else terrorized by nutcases on the internet on the basis of immutable characteristics <em>or</em> personal choices.</p>

<p>But Wu has written publicly about several statements to police and at least one restraining order regarding this individual. She describes his most recent travail this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The week before last, I went to court to file a restraining order against a man who calls himself “The Commander.” He made a video holding up a knife, explaining how he’ll murder me “Assassin’s Creed Style.” He wrecked his car en route to my house to “deliver justice.” In logs that leaked, he claimed to have weapons and a compatriot to do a drive-by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wu&#8217;s most persistent and terrifying harasser (but by no means her only one) looks pretty clearly to be guilty of criminal harassment under Massachusetts law:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whoever willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, shall be guilty of the crime of criminal harassment and shall be punished by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than 21/2 years or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment. The conduct or acts described in this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, conduct or acts conducted by mail or by use of a telephonic or telecommunication device or electronic communication device including, but not limited to, any device that transfers signs, signals, <em>writing, images, sounds</em>, data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo-electronic or photo-optical system, including, but not limited to, <em>electronic mail, internet communications, instant messages</em> or facsimile communications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter265/Section43A" target="_blank">Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, § 43A(a)</a> (emphases added).</p>

<p>He also appears guilty of stalking, as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whoever (1) willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and (2) makes a threat with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury, shall be guilty of the crime of stalking and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 5 years or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than 21/2 years or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter265/Section43" target="_blank">Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, § 43(a)</a>.</p>

<p>That provision defines the relevant conduct in the same way the previously quoted subsection does, including the use of the internet. It also adds that if the stalking is committed in violation of a restraining order the defendant must be sentenced to a <em>minimum</em> of one year year imprisonment.</p>

<p>So, while I want to repeat that I&#8217;m not a Massachusetts lawyer, it&#8217;s unclear to me why the District Attorney in Wu&#8217;s county has yet to bring charges against this man. One thing I&#8217;ve learned as a judicial law clerk is that the internet is an unusually powerful tool for criminal prosecutions, because much of the material is posted publicly, and many people don&#8217;t think to clean up their evidence trail when it&#8217;s made of ones and zeroes.</p>

<p>But the fact that the crime is perpetrated in binary makes it no less criminal. Maybe there is a reluctance on the part of some prosectuors to dive too deeply into cases based primarily on digital evidence simply because they lack experience in evaluating it and explaining it to a jury. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a valid excuse, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, please, <em>please</em> <a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/63466-im-brianna-wu-and-im-risking-my-life-standing-up-to-gamergate" target="_blank">read Wu&#8217;s entire article on this issue</a> and stand with her and others against the lunatics perpetrating this harassment. You should also subscribe to the podcast she does with Christina Warren (<a href="http://twitter.com/filmgirl" target="_blank">@filmgirl</a>) and Simone de Rochefort (<a href="http://twitter.com/doomquasar" target="_blank">@doomquasar</a>). It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.relay.fm/rocket" target="_blank">Rocket</a> and it&#8217;s great.</p></div>
