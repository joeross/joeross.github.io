<blockquote>
  <p>Poulshock, 38, is writing source code for each law, which can then be entered into computers and applied to fact patterns. (The project is open source, online at GitHub). Tax and immigration law lend themselves to this approach more easily than some other areas, but in many instances, he says, law can be turned into a mathematical function: If this, then that; if these, then that or those.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great idea, and one I&#8217;ll definitely keep an eye on. Very cool.</p></div>
