Peter Baker of *The New York Times*:

> In his second term, Mr. Obama embarked on an effort to use clemency and has raised his total commutations to 43, a number he may double this month. The initiative was begun last year by James M. Cole, then the deputy attorney general, who set criteria for who might qualify: generally nonviolent inmates who have served more than 10 years in prison, have behaved well while incarcerated and would not have received as lengthy a sentence under todayâ€™s revised rules. 

Overincarceration is a real problem. Like any decent lawyer, I'll [cite](http://www.npr.org/2013/02/01/169732840/when-crime-pays-prison-can-teach-some-to-be-better-criminals) a [few](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/federal-bureau-of-prisons-medication-assisted-therapy-115998.html) reliable [sources](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/03/prison_reform_releasing_only_nonviolent_offenders_won_t_get_you_very_far.html). 

I don't have an answer. Longtime readers will know I'm a cynical bastard, despite my best efforts to the contrary. It seems to me like this move is [more for the "optics"](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/12/president-obama-to-be-first-sitting-president-to-visit-federal-prison/) and less for real effect, but I'd love to be wrong.
