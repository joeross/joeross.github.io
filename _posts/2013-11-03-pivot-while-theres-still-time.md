<a href='http://bobbyonboard.com/never-been-released-before-information-on-where-flud-was-going-before-its-180-pivot-from-b2c-to-b2b'>Pivot while there's still time</a><div class="link_description"><p>Bobby Ghoshal, co-founder of the now-defunct social news app Flud:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year after pivoting to the enterprise we were out of business [&#8230;] because we ran out of money and investors didnâ€™t have enough data to make a decision to jump on board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>I buy this reasoning. I read a lot about venture capital investors and how they conduct their due diligence.</p>

<p>Investors want to (as they should) gorge themselves on data before even discussing the possibility of backing your startup.</p>

<p>But if the first iteration of your idea falters and you&#8217;re too late to accept it or notice it or implement a pivot, getting to the next phase of development won&#8217;t save you because, as Ghoshal notes, the data won&#8217;t be there to convince investors to sign on the line which is dotted.</p>

<p>Of course, passion and user engagement is important when you&#8217;re building an app with a backend service. But all passion and users usually get you is a meeting.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s data that closes deals.</p></div>
