[Crisis shelter workers want Google Maps to hide the locations of their shelters](http://www.dailydot.com/technology/google-maps-domestic-violence-shelter-locations/)

[Selena Larson](http://selenalarson.com/) reports at *The Daily Dot*:

> Crisis shelters provide a safe haven for victims and their families; they are a refuge away from abusers. By publicly listing shelter locations online, Google is endangering victims of domestic abuse, says Jeremy Janice, a facilities coordinator at a Louisiana crisis center.

It's yet another example of my white American cis-male privilege that it never even occurred to me that this is problematic. I hope Google comes up with a solution that helps keep people safe. I'm not sure how effective Change.org petitions really are, but you can sign the one relevant to this issue [here](https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-remove-maps-to-secret-domestic-violence-shelters).
