<a href='http://bigstory.ap.org/article/condoleezza-rice-decides-against-rutgers-address'>Condoleezza Rice backs out of Rutgers commencement</a><div class="link_description"><p>The Associated Press reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The school&#8217;s board of governors had voted to pay $35,000 to the former secretary of state under President George W. Bush and national security adviser for her appearance at the May 18 ceremony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any question involving money, and therefore just about any question at all, boils down at some point to supply and demand. I understand schools want to attract high-profile commencement speakers. But the fact that Rutgers would offer, and Rice would accept, <em>$35,000</em>, to speak for less than an hour, is shameful.</p>

<p>Schools should not be willing to supply so much money, and speakers, often wealthy, should not demand it. For a more thorough treatment of this topic, read the excellent 2011 essay &#8220;Commencement Cash Cow&#8221; by Pablo Eisenberg <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2011/05/09/essay_criticizing_the_practice_of_paying_graduation_speakers" target="_blank">at InsideHigherEd</a>.</p></div>
