<a href='http://maplight.org/content/stocks-owned-congress'>MapLight data: 69 members of Congress hold at least $38.5M stock in 15 private companies</a><div class="link_description"><p>I am ashamed to admit I always assumed members of Congress were prohibited from direct investment in private companies.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>I thought aggregate investments like mutual funds were probably okay, but assumed members had to divest stock holdings upon election.</p>

<p>After all, how can someone be trusted to regulate, or deregulate for that matter, a company or industry in which they have a personal stake?</p>

<p>Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>And the $38.5 million number is the <em>low</em> end. Disclosures are made using <em>ranges</em>. The high end brings possible investment in private stock by members of Congress to $116.3 million.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not even an exhaustive number. It&#8217;s <em>only</em> the top 15 most commonly invested-in companies. All at a time when issues like net neutrality, climate change and privacy, all of which implicate more than one company on that list, are ripe for revised regulation.</p></div>
