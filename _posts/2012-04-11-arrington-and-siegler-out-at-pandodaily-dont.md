<blockquote>
  <p>As of Monday, April 9 the shareholders of PandoMedia voted to remove Michael Arrington as a director. Given the change in relationship we feel it&#8217;s inappropriate for CrunchFund&#8217;s partners Michael Arrington and MG Siegler to continue contributing to PandoDaily.</p>

<p>via <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/09/investor-update/" target="_blank">pandodaily.com</a></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>Arrington has taken the news well, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] the company notified me last week that they weren&#8217;t happy that I and MG Siegler (my partner at CrunchFund) were going to speak at TechCrunch Disrupt this coming May.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even when I&#8217;m being thrown out, I support the entrepreneur. If Sarah feels that they&#8217;re better off without our involvement, I support her completely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>both quotes from Arrington&#8217;s <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2012/04/09/about-pando/" target="_blank">post about the issue</a></p>

<p>Apparently, the fact that <a href="http://uncrunched.com" target="_blank">Arrington</a> and fellow <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/crunchfund" target="_blank">CrunchFund</a> (&lt; irony alert Re: that link&#8230;) partner <a href="http://parislemon.com" target="_blank">MG Siegler</a> are speaking at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/" target="_blank">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> was a firing offense. Siegler seemed <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/20832114453/pando" target="_blank">as confused</a> as Arrington, because <a href="http://pandodaily.com/" target="_blank"><em>PandoDaily</em></a> founder <a href="http://pandodaily.com/author/pandosarahlacy/" target="_blank">Sarah Lacey</a> knew about Arrington&#8217;s contractual obligation to speak at the conference when she took him on as an investor.</p>

<p>What confuses <em>me</em> though is that Lacey disabled comments on her <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/09/investor-update/" target="_blank">post announcing Arrington&#8217;s removal</a>.</p>

<p>Why? Well, it&#8217;s stupid to speculate, but I&#8217;m feeling stupid at the moment. Maybe comments were disabled&#8230;</p>

<ol><li>Because they&#8217;ll be largely negative? Maybe. Arrington and Siegler are full of a fire and insight that command pageviews like few other writers in the tech space.</li>
<li>Because they would have been pointless? Maybe. After all, the deed is done.</li>
<li>Because they would have been <em>positive</em> as in you-don&#8217;t-need-&#8216;em, casting aspersions on Arrington and Siegler, former colleagues and still friends of Lacey&#8217;s? Maybe, but that&#8217;s the nature of the beast.</li>
<li>Because Lacey got some advice about minimizing speculation and keeping the focus on the content, not what goes on behind the scenes. </li>
<li>Because Lacey got some advice about maximizing speculation and keeping the focus on both the content <em>and</em> what goes on behind the scenes. </li>
<li>Because the <em>Pando&#8217;</em> board didn&#8217;t want to allow a potentially mean-spirited conversation about a decision they made on the site about which they made that decision. </li>
</ol><p>I like PandoDaily. The writers are great, the focus is great, the content is great. And they have a healthy commenting community.</p>

<p>All parties concerned are too thick-skinned for 1 or 3 to be accurate. 2 has never stopped a popular website from leaving comments enabled before.</p>

<p>4 and 5 are doubtful because Lacey is smart enough to know both are good suggestions, depending on the topic in question and the nature of your publication.</p>

<p>6 would just mean Lacey isn&#8217;t truly in control over there, and I find that very hard to believe.</p>

<p>So, my speculation seems to have turned out just as stupidly as I had expected. Turns out I wasn&#8217;t the only one engaged in stupid speculation, though.</p>

<p>Incidentally, <em>Business Insider</em>'s Matt Rosoff <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pandodaily-splits-with-techcrunch-founder-mike-arrington-2012-4?op=1" target="_blank">claims</a> the Arrington/Siegler tag team at <em>Disrupt</em> &#8220;pissed off PandoDaily CEO Andrew Anker,&#8221; implying that Arrington&#8217;s post about the issue suggested that. It didn&#8217;t, and Rosoff doesn&#8217;t mention any other potential source for the Anker line <em>at all</em>. Stupid speculation FTW!</p>

<p>At the end of the day, people are talking about <em>Pando</em>, and that can&#8217;t be a bad thing.</p>
