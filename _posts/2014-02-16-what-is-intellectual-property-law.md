<a href='http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/02/what-intellectual-property.html'>What is Intellectual Property Law?</a><div class="link_description"><p>It’s not surprising that more scholarship self-identifying as IP-focused is about patents. After all, they drive much of commerce and innovation (and arguably the problems with the two) in the industrial and technology sectors. </p>

<p>It’s worth noting though that, unlike much of the protection afforded by a patent, many copyright protections are available even without registration, although it&#8217;s admittedly difficult to enforce them via litigation and to win statuory damages without timely registration.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF by the U.S. Copyright Office</a> for more information.</p></div>
