<blockquote>
  <p>The Report proposes a series of rather radical — in the Jeffersonian sense — reforms, from dramatically shortening the copyright term (a no-brainer, actually) to expanding fair use and limiting the damages from infringement claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report&#8217;s recommendations don&#8217;t go quite as far as my suggestion that <a href="http://joeross.me/post/28065827946/the-pinterest-er-tumblr-problem-fair-use-and-a" target="_blank">fair use should be assumed rather than merely an affirmative defense</a>, but Professor Post is right to highlight the opportunity for the GOP to differentiate on this issue.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;m not sure there is much in there with which I would disagree, excepting the over-the-top (and even italicized) final sentence of the report&#8217;s conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current copyright law does not merely distort some markets – rather it destroys entire markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s wrong. The current US copyright regime limits access, hinders creativity, and dampens innovation, thereby frustrating copyright&#8217;s Constitutional purpose. That fact, and I do consider it a fact, must be the foundation of the copyright reform we need in this country.</p></div>
