<a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/mit-swartz-intervene/'>MIT wants pre-release review of Secret Service file on Aaron Swartz</a><div class="link_description"><p>Kevin Poulsen, at <em>Wired</em>'s Threat Level blog:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>MIT has screwed up repeatedly throughout this ordeal, and this is not a sign of improvement. If anything, their interference itself might prompt anonymous hackers to launch new salvos against their networks or <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doxing" target="_blank">dox</a> their personnel.</p></div>
