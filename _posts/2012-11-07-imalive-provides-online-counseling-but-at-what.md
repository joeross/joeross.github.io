<a href='http://www.dailydot.com/news/imalive-counseling-tumblr-help/'>IMAlive provides online counseling—but at what cost?</a><div class="link_description"><p>Aja Romano of <em>The Daily Dot</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IMAlive sounds perfect for introverts and those who are more comfortable writing than speaking. And anyone can volunteer to be a counselor, as long as they pass the background check. But there’s a hitch. Potential volunteers have to pay the organization $280 up front—before they even have their first IM session.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is much in Romano&#8217;s article that I didn&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s worth reading if this issue is important to you, and worth paying strong heed to if you&#8217;re considering any association with the organizations it discusses.</p></div>
