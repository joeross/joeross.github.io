<a href='http://news.yahoo.com/york-lawsuit-seeks-39-legal-personhood-39-chimpanzees-213853037.html'>Personhood for chimps? Not any time soon.</a><div class="link_description"><p>It&#8217;s a noble cause, but a flawed strategy. Victory is unlikely, but even if achieved it will be quickly squelched by legislation redefining personhood as belonging only to human beings.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s one of the problems universal marriage proponents have had: some courts have said gay couples have a right to marry, but many legislatures, including most notably the U.S. Congress via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act" target="_blank">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, have simply legislated a definition of marriage that explicitly excludes those deemed unworthy of the right.</p>

<p>Luckily, DOMA was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor" target="_blank">ruled unconstitutional</a> this year (I&#8217;m ashamed to say I apparently failed to blog about the June 2013 decision&#8230;). But it was the culmination of a long battle for the plaintiff and an even longer one for opponents of the ludicrous insult to the constitution that was DOMA.</p>

<p>In short, it&#8217;ll be a long time before the law purports to give a damn about how depressed a chimp in a trailer park feels. And that&#8217;s a damn shame.</p></div>
