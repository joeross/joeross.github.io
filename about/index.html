title: Joe Ross is a geek.

<div class="blurb">

<p>My name is Joe Ross. I share links and write articles here about law, technology and other topics I find interesting.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I hate when several consecutive paragraphs begin with &ldquo;my&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rdquo; but on one&rsquo;s biography page, it&rsquo;s simply inevitable. I have forgiven myself, and I hope you can forgive me as well.</p>

<h3>Where I Came From</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in southern New Jersey and moved to Philadelphia when I began college.</p>

<h3>How I Got Learned</h3>

<p>I got a degree in literature from Saint Joe&rsquo;s in Philly, where I focused on literary theory. I also have a JD from Temple Law, where I obsessed over privacy, copyright and international law.</p>

<p>I frequently use the &ldquo;JD&rdquo; suffix after my name. I <em>know</em> it can look arrogant and annoying but it was <em>expensive</em> and I deserve it. I&rsquo;m also a member of the Temple Law Alumni Association&rsquo;s Membership Committee.</p>

<h3>Present-tense</h3>

<p>I live in the Princeton area now with my wife, a pretty scientist named Megan. I&rsquo;m the digital editor at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fa+href%3D&amp;t=NGM1YmE2Y2UwNWI5MGZjMGQ4ZDhhYjcxYjY2NTdkMjJiMDc3MjkwMyxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D" http:="">NJBIZ</a>, a business journal, where I use data, social media and a finely-tuned sense of lulz to build our digital readership.</p>

<h3>Best and Worst</h3>

<p>I am best when talking, researching, and writing about stuff that makes me talk fast and contemplatively furrow my brow. I am worst in the morning, pre-coffee. Avoid me if at all possible, or, in the alternative, bring me coffee.</p>

<h3>Self-image</h3>

<p>I self-identify as an editor, gamer, geek, musician, pop-punk fan and writer, all without hesitation or apology.</p>
