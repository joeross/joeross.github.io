# Who?

My name is Joe Ross. I share links and write articles here about law, technology and other topics I find interesting.

### Introduction

I hate when several consecutive paragraphs begin with "my" or "I" but on one's biography page, it's simply inevitable. I have forgiven myself, and I hope you can forgive me as well.

### Where I Came From

I was born and raised in southern New Jersey and moved to Philadelphia when I began college.

### How I Got Learned

I got a degree in literature from Saint Joe's in Philly, where I focused on literary theory. I also have a JD from Temple Law, where I obsessed over privacy, copyright and international law.

I frequently use the "JD" suffix after my name. I _know_ it can look arrogant and annoying but it was _expensive_ and I deserve it. I'm also a member of the Temple Law Alumni Association's Membership Committee.

### Present-tense

I live in the Princeton area now with my wife, a pretty scientist named Megan. I'm the digital editor at [NJBIZ][14], a business journal, where I use data, social media and a finely-tuned sense of lulz to build our digital readership.

### Best and Worst

I am best when talking, researching, and writing about stuff that makes me talk fast and contemplatively furrow my brow. I am worst in the morning, pre-coffee. Avoid me if at all possible, or, in the alternative, bring me coffee.

### Self-image

I self-identify as an editor, gamer, geek, musician, pop-punk fan and writer, all without hesitation or apology.

### Miscellany

Read the more boring aspects of my work history in my [resume][15]. Peruse my curious and eclectic musical tastes at [Last.fm][16]. Find me on Tumblr at [Geekeries][17]. See my embarassing taste in what constitutes photos worth sharing at [Instagram][18].
